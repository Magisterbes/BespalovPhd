Besides androgen independence, subpopulations of the tumor are genetically heterogeneous. With the advent of tumor genome sequencing we asked which has the greater influence on reducing tumor size: genetic background, heterogeneity, or drug potency?. Methods: A previously developed theoretical evolutionary dynamics model of stochastic branching processes is applied to compute the probability of tumor eradication with two targeted drugs. Publicly available data sets were surveyed to parameterize the model. Results: Our calculations reveal that the greatest influence on successful treatment is the genetic background including the number of mutations overcoming resistance. Another important criteria is the tumor size at which it is still possible to achieve tumor eradication, for example, 2-4 cm large tumors have at best a 10% probability to be eradicated when 50 mutations can confer resistance to each drug. Conclusion: Overall, this study finds that genetic background and tumor heterogeneity are more important than drug potency in treating mCRPC. It also points toward identifying metastatic sites early using biochemical assays and/or dPET. © 2018 The Authors.

This study aims to develop a predictive model based on machine learning algorithms to identify patients at high risk of readmission. Methods: A retrospective dataset (2001ñ2017) including 16,902 patients admitted into a large inpatient rehabilitation facility in North Carolina was collected in 2017. Three types of machine learning models with different predictors were compared in 2018. The model with the highest c-statistic was selected as the best model and further tested by using five sets of training and validation data with different split time. The optimum threshold for classification was identified. Results: The logistic regression model with only functional independence measures has the highest validation c-statistic at 0.852. Using this model to predict the recent 5 years acute care readmissions yielded high discriminative ability (c-statistics: 0.841ñ0.869). Larger training data yielded better performance on the test data. The default cutoff (0.5) resulted in high specificity (>0.997) but low sensitivity (<0.07). The optimum threshold helped to achieve a balance between sensitivity (0.754ñ0.867) and specificity (0.747ñ0.780). Conclusions: This study demonstrates that functional independence measures can be analyzed by using machine learning algorithms to predict acute care readmissions, thus improving the effectiveness of preventive medicine. © 2018 Elsevier Inc. ; Functional independence measure, Machine learning, Readmission, Rehabilitation ; Artificial intelligence, Forecasting, Learning systems, Patient rehabilitation, Regression analysis, Discriminative ability, Functional independence measures, Logistic Regression modeling, Machine learning approaches, Machine learning models, Predictive modeling, Preventive medicines, Readmission, Learning algorithms, adult, Article, controlled study, emergency ward, female, health service, hospital discharge, hospital readmission, human, machine learning, major clinical study, male, North Carolina, patient care, prediction, priority journal, retrospective study, risk factor, sensitivity and specificity, validation study,,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053464663

Alas, little is known about the underlying mechanisms and thus finding interventions to reduce unwarranted variations remains difficult, hampering quality, equity, and efficiency of care. Whereas statistical analyses describe deviations from ideal patterns, ethnographically inspired analyses aim at understanding when, how, and why variations occur in practice. Based on case studies derived from shadowing emergency physicians, I demonstrate that analyzing practice variation in practice helps to (a) advance the understanding of mechanisms and (b) evaluate/expand the existing repertoire of interventions. Results revealed unmet expectations and new sources of known variations as well as interventions complementing systemic changes with those that empower individuals to better cope with the existing system. These findings highlight the benefits of mixed-methods for understanding and tackling practice variation. © 2018, The Author(s) 2018. ; clinical decision making,, emergency care in the Midwest of the USA, ethnography, health policy, mixed-methods, unwarranted practice variation,,,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85047423193

These designs are often used to obtain more representative samples from the tails of the underlying distribution using the easy to access rank information during the sampling process. We propose new loss functions to incorporate the rank information of nominated samples in the estimation process. Also, we provide an alternative approach that translates estimation problems with nominated samples to corresponding problems under simple random sampling (SRS). Strategies are given to choose proper nomination sampling designs for a given population quantile. Numerical studies show that quantile regression models with maxima (or minima) nominated samples have higher relative efficiencies compared with their counterparts under SRS for analyzing the upper (or lower) tail quantiles of the distribution of the response variable. Results are then implemented on a large cohort study in the Canadian province of Manitoba to analyze quantiles of bone mineral density using available covariates. We show that in some cases, methods based on nomination sampling designs require about one-tenth of the sample used in SRS to estimate the lower or upper tail conditional quantiles with comparable mean squared errors. This is a dramatic reduction in time and cost compared with the usual SRS approach.

However, social and demographic inequalities in accessing health care services exist in both developed and developing countries. This study examined the demographic and socio-economic factors associated with the lack of access to public clinics in the Greater Kuala Lumpur area. Materials and Methods: The study employed a survey involving 1032 participants. Data were collected using self-administered questionnaires distributed between October and December 2015 in the Greater Kuala Lumpur area. Results: Of the 1032 participants, 535 were public clinic users. A quarter (25.8%) of the users stated that they did not have access to public clinics in their residential area. A multiple logistic analysis showed that the elderly, the women, those from ethnic minority groups, those of lower family income, and the private sector workers were more likely not to have access to public clinics than their counterparts. Conclusions: The existing level of accessibility to public clinics could be improved by increasing the number of clinics. Clinics should be established to focus more on reaching the elderly, the women, the ethnic minority groups, the poorer families, and the private sector employees. © 2018, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya.

While group model building (GMB) has been effectively applied in developing system dynamics models (SD), few studies have used GMB for developing an agent-based model (ABM). This article explores the use of a GMB approach to develop an ABM focused on food insecurity. In our GMB workshops, we modified a set of the standard GMB scripts to develop and validate an ABM in collaboration with local experts and stakeholders. Based on this experience, we learned that GMB is a useful collaborative modeling platform for modelers and community experts to address local population health issues. We also provide suggestions for increasing the use of the GMB approach to develop rigorous, useful, and validated ABMs. © 2018, The New York Academy of Medicine. ; Agent-based modeling, Food insecurity, Group model building, System dynamics, Systems science,,,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85043688353

One of the consequences will be an increasing need for blood products to treat age-related diseases. Donation services rely on voluntariness and charitable motivation. It might be questioned whether there will be sufficient blood supply with voluntary donation. The present study focused on elicitation of preferences for incentives and aimed to contribute to the discussion on how to increase donation rates. Methods: A self-administered discrete choice experiment (DCE) was applied. Respondents were repeatedly asked to choose between hypothetical blood donation centers. In case of reluctance to receiving incentives a none-option was included. Random parameter logit (RPL) and latent class models (LCM) were used for analysis. Results: The study sample included 416 college students from the US and Germany. Choice decisions were significantly influenced by the characteristics of the donation center in the DCE. Incentives most preferred were monetary compensation, paid leave, and blood screening test. LCM identified subgroups with preference heterogeneity. Small subgroups indicated moderate to strong aversion to incentives. Conclusion: The majority of the sample positively responded to incentives and indicated a willingness to accept incentives. In face of future challenges, the judicious use and appropriate utilization of incentives might be an option to motivate potential donors and should be open to discussion. © 2018 S.

Methods: A micro-simulation model was developed to monitor a cohort of patients with breast cancer, and also an estimation was made on the probability of surviving the monitoring period financed by the SPSS. Using the Monte Carlo simulation, the maximum expected cost was estimated to broaden such monitoring. Morbimortality information of the Ministry of Health and cases of breast cancer treated by the SPSS were used. Results: Between 2013 and 2026, the financial resources to provide monitoring during 10 years to women diagnosed with breast cancer would reach up to $3607.40 million pesos on a base scenario, $4151.79 million pesos on the pessimistic scenario and $3414.85 million pesos on an optimistic scenario. In the base scenario, additional expenditure represents an annual increase of 9.1% of resources allocated to treating this disease, and 3.0% of the availability of the resources for the Fondo de Proteccion contra Gastos Catastroficos (FPGC-Fund for Protection against Catastrophic Expenditure). Conclusions: Increasing monitoring for patients with breast cancer would not represent a financial risk to the sustainability of the FPGC, and could increase patients survival and life quality. © 2018 The Author(s). ; Breast cancer, Financial management, Financial risk, Micro simulation, Monte Carlo method ; adult, aged, Article, breast cancer, cancer incidence, cancer mortality, cancer risk, cancer survival, cancer therapy, cohort analysis, controlled study, fatality, female, financial management, follow up, funding, groups by age, health care availability, health care cost, health care planning, health care system, human, major clinical study, Mexico, middle aged, Monte Carlo method, morbidity, mortality rate, patient monitoring, probability, risk assessment, risk factor, simulation, very elderly, young adult,,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85043476351

Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort of HIV-infected adult patients under care between 2001 and 2012. Disparities in clinical evolution of anal intraepithelial neoplasia to high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) and invasive anal cancer were evaluated in a three-state Markov model adjusted for cytology misclassification. We studied sociodemographic covariate effects for each state transition using multivariable models controlling for antiretroviral therapy and infrared coagulation treatment of HSIL. Results: Among 2804 patients with a median age of 40†years, 78% were MSM and 38% non-white. There were no disparities in HSIL prevalence (14%) by age, sex, race, or risk group. After 4.0†years of follow-up, 23 patients developed invasive anal cancer. Females and black patients had lower transition rates from <HSIL>HSIL (HR†=†0.35 and HR†=†0.55, respectively), those with age >40 had lower rates of both <HSIL>HSIL progression (HR†=†0.64) and HSIL><HSIL regression (HR†=†0.56), and MSM had higher rates of progression from <HSIL>HSIL (HR†=†3.30). Controlling for antiretroviral therapy and infrared coagulation (IRC) treatment as time-updated covariates, the univariable effects of sex, black race, and HIV risk factor remained significant. Conclusions: Black race was not associated with prevalent anal intraepithelial neoplasia nor with post-baseline progression of anal intraepithelial neoplasia. © 2017, W.

This is a retrospective cohort study, based on a population of 524 women, who were diagnosed with breast cancer in the period from 1993 to 1995 and monitored until 2011, residents in the city of Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil. The cutoff points for the variable of age were defined with Cox simple models. In the settings of simple and multiple Fine-Gray models, age was not significant to the presence of competing risks, neither it was in Cox models. For both models, death by breast cancer was the event of interest. The survival functions, estimated by Kaplan-Meier, showed significant differences for deaths by breast cancer and by competing risks. Survival functions by breast cancer did not show significant differences when comparing the age groups, according to log-rank test.

These films exhibit high PM2.5 (particles with aerodynamic diameters less than 2.5†?m) removal efficiency and relatively low air resistance. Thus, coating window screens with nanofiber films may be able to mitigate residential exposure to PM2.5 of outdoor origin. This study developed a method for assessing the performance of nanofiber window screens in reducing residential exposure to PM2.5 of outdoor origin in Beijing. The results show that the use of selected nanofiber window screens all the time throughout the year can reduce the mean value of the annual average indoor PM2.5 of outdoor origin by 64%-66% for Beijing residences. However, the mean value of annual harmonic average air exchange rate when the windows are open was also reduced from 2.34†h?1 to 0.27-0.35†h?1, which is far below the national standard. If the nanofiber window screens were used only when the outdoor PM2.5 pollution was severe, the screens had less of an impact on residential natural ventilation, but the national standard still could not be met. Hence, more efforts are needed to further reduce the air resistance of nanofiber window screens in order to ensure proper residential ventilation. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

A major challenge in the development of highly concentrated mAb solutions is their long-term stability and often incalculable viscosity. The complexity of the molecule itself, as well as the various molecular interactions, make it difficult to describe their solution behavior. To study the formulation stability, long- and short-range interactions and the formation of complex network structures have to be taken into account. For a better understanding of highly concentrated solutions, we combined established and novel analytical tools to characterize the effect of solution properties on the stability of highly concentrated mAb formulations. In this study, monoclonal antibody solutions in a concentration range of 50ñ200†mg/ml at pH 5ñ9 with and without glycine, PEG4000, and Na2SO4 were analyzed. To determine the monomer content, analytical size-exclusion chromatography runs were performed. ?-potential measurements were conducted to analyze the electrophoretic properties in different solutions. The melting and aggregation temperatures were determined with the help of fluorescence and static light scattering measurements. Additionally, rheological measurements were conducted to study the solution viscosity and viscoelastic behavior of the mAb solutions. The so-determined analytical parameters were scored and merged in an analytical toolbox. The resulting scoring was then successfully correlated with long-term storage (40 d of incubation) experiments. Our results indicate that the sensitivity of complex rheological measurements, in combination with the applied techniques, allows reliable statements to be made with respect to the effect of solution properties, such as protein concentration, ionic strength, and pH shift, on the strength of protein-protein interaction and solution colloidal stability. © 2017 The Author(s).

Results: Overall 0.532-0.884 remaining life years were lost from donating a kidney. This was equivalent to 1.20%-2.34% of remaining life years (or 0.76%-1.51% remaining QALYs). The risk was higher in male and black individuals. The study showed that 1%-5% of average-age current live kidney donors might develop ESRD as a result of nephrectomy. The added risk of ESRD resulted in a loss of only 0.126-0.344 remaining life years. Most of the loss of life was predicted to be associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) not ESRD. Most events occurred 25 or more years after donation. Reducing the increased risk of death associated with CKD had a modest overall effect on the per cent loss of remaining life years (0.72%-1.9%) and QALYs (0.58%-1.33%). Smoking and obesity reduced life expectancy and increased overall lifetime risks of ESRD in non-donors. However the percentage loss of remaining life years from donation was not very different in those with or without these risk factors. Conclusion: Live kidney donation may reduce life expectancy by 0.5-1 year in most donors. The development of ESRD in donors may not be the only measure of risk as most of the predicted loss of life predates ESRD. The study identifies the potential importance of following donors and treating risk factors aggressively to prevent ESRD and to improve donor survival. © 2017 Article author(s).

Substantial amounts of road dust are repeatedly resuspended, in particular at traffic lights and junctions where more braking is involved, causing potential threat to pedestrians, especially children. In order to determine the degree of contamination in the heavily traffic-congested cities of Poland, a total of 148 samples of road dust (RD), sludge from storm drains (SL) and roadside soil (RS) were collected. Sixteen metals were analysed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) and atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) in all samples. Chemical evaluation followed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) revealed that road environments have been severely contaminated with traffic-related elements. Concentration of copper in all road-environment samples is even higher, exceeding even up to 15 times its average concentrations established for the surrounding soils. Non-carcinogenic health risk assessment revealed that the hazard index (HI) for children in all road-environment samples exceeds the safe level of 1. Therefore, greater attention should be paid to potential health risks caused by the ingestion of traffic-related particles during outdoor activities. © 2017 by the authors.

We develop a framework to guide optimal treatment decisions for a deteriorating chronic disease when treatment technologies are improving over time. We formulate an optimal stopping problem using a discrete-time, finite-horizon Markov decision process. The goal is to maximize a patientís quality-adjusted life expectancy. We derive structural properties of the model and analytically solve a three-period treatment decision problem. We illustrate the model with the example of treatment for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV). Chronic HCV affects 3-4 million Americans and has been historically difficult to treat, but increasingly effective treatments have been commercialized in the past few years. We show that the optimal treatment decision is more likely to be to accept currently available treatmentódespite expectations for future treatment improvementófor patients who have high-risk history, who are older, or who have more comorbidities. Insights from this study can guide HCV treatment decisions for individual patients. More broadly, our model can guide treatment decisions for curable chronic diseases by finding the optimal treatment policy for individual patients in a heterogeneous population. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York. ; Decision analysis, Dynamic programming, Hepatitis C treatment, Markov decision process, Medical decision making, Technology adoption ; antivirus agent, decision support system, female, Hepatitis C, Chronic, human, male, Markov chain, medical technology, middle aged, quality adjusted life year, risk assessment, theoretical model, total quality management, treatment outcome, Antiviral Agents, Biomedical Technology, Decision Support Techniques, Female, Hepatitis C, Chronic, Humans, Male, Markov Chains, Middle Aged, Models, Theoretical, Quality Improvement, Quality-Adjusted Life Years, Risk Assessment, Treatment Outcome ; 26188961,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84937152905

Host-bacterium interaction is a key step to TB establishment and the proteases produced by these microorganisms seem to facilitate bacteria invasion, migration and host immune response evasion. We presented, for the first time, the identification, biochemical characterization, molecular dynamics (MDs) and immunomodulatory properties of a prolyl oligopeptidase (POP) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (POPMt). POP is a serine protease that hydrolyzes substrates with high specificity for proline residues and has already been characterized as virulence factor in infectious diseases. POPMt reveals catalytic activity upon N-Suc-Gly-Pro-Leu-Gly-Pro-AMC, a recognized POP substrate, with optimal activity at pH 7.5 and 37∞C. The enzyme presents KM and Kcat/KM values of 108 ?M and 21.838 mM-1 s-1, respectively. MDs showed that POPMt structure is similar to that of others POPs, which consists of a cylindrical architecture divided into an ?/? hydrolase catalytic domain and a ?-propeller domain. Finally, POPMt was capable of triggering in vitro secretion of proinflammatory cytokines by peritoneal macrophages, an event dependent on POPMt intact structure. Our data suggests that POPMt may contribute to an inflammatory response during M. tuberculosis infection. © 2017 Portugal, Motta, Correa, Nolasco, de Almeida, Magalhaes, Atta, Vieira, Bastos and Santana. ; Fluorescence spectroscopy, Molecular dynamic, Mycobacterium tuberculosis protease, Proinflammatory cytokines, Prolyl oligopeptidase, Serine protease, Tuberculosis ; cytokine, dithiothreitol, prolyl endopeptidase, sodium chloride, animal cell, Article, bacterial growth, bacterium culture, cell invasion, cell migration, enzyme activity, enzyme analysis, enzyme specificity, fluorescence spectroscopy, gene, gene expression, immune response, immunomodulation, kinetic parameters, molecular cloning, molecular dynamics, mouse, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, nonhuman, peritoneum macrophage, pH, popmt gene, protein purification, sequence homology, temperature, Western blotting,,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85014511650

METHODS: Our study used data from the 26 State capitals and Federal District of Brazil obtained by the National Survey on Health (PNS) and Vigitel, both held in 2013. In each capital, we added a subsample of 200 adults living in households with only mobile phones, extracted from PNS, to the Vigitel 2013 database, with approximately 1,900 households, named Vigitel dual frame. RESULTS: Vigitel results showed absolute relative biases between 0.18% and 14.85%. The system underestimated the frequency of adult smokers (10.77%), whole milk consumption (52.82%), and soft drink consumption (22.22%). Additionally, it overestimated the prevalence of hypertension (25.46%). In the simulations using Vigitel dual frame, with inclusion of the sample of adults living in households with only mobile phones, the bias of estimates was reduced in five out of eight analyzed indicators, with greater effects in regions with lower rates of landline coverage. In comparing regions, we observed negative correlation (? = -0.91) between the percentage of indicators with presence of bias and the percentage of households with only mobile phone. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate the benefits of including a subsample of 200 adults with only mobile phone on the Vigitel sample, especially in the capitals of the North and Northeast regions. ; Cell phones, Chronic disease, Data collection, Epidemiology, Frames, Health surveys, Interviews as topic, Utilization ; adolescent, adult, aged, chronic disease, devices, female, health survey, human, interview, male, middle aged, mobile phone, procedures, register, risk factor, utilization, young adult, Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Cell Phones, Chronic Disease, Female, Health Surveys, Humans, Interviews as Topic, Male, Middle Aged, Registries, Risk Factors, Young Adult ; 28591355,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020286497

In order to better understand contraceptive choice within this environment, stated preference methods are utilized to ask doctors about what contraceptive options they would discuss with different types of women. The role of doctors is to confine their discussion to a subset of products that best match their patient. This subset of options forms the consideration set from which the ultimate recommendation is made. Given the existence of consideration sets we address the issue of how to model appropriately the ultimate recommendations. The estimated models enable us to characterize doctor recommendations and how they vary with patient attributes and to highlight where recommendations are clear and when they are uncertain. The results also indicate systematic variation in recommendations across different types of doctors, and in particular we observe that some doctors are reluctant to embrace new products and instead recommend those that are more familiar. Such effects are one possible explanation for the relatively low uptake of more cost effective longer acting reversible contraceptives and indicate that further education and training of doctors may be warranted.

Survey data were collected from 775 GPs and 1379 Danish citizens eliciting preferences for a consultation. Sequential models allowing for within-person preference heterogeneity and heteroskedasticity between best and worst choices were estimated. We show that GPs do not always act as perfect agents and that this non-alignment stems from GPs being both unable and unwilling to do so. Unable since GPs have imperfect information about patientsí preferences, and unwilling since they are also motivated by other factors than user orientation. Our findings highlight the need for multi-pronged strategies targeting different motivational factors to ensure that GPs act in correspondence with patientsí preferences in areas where alignment is warranted. © 2016 Elsevier B.V. ; Agency theory, Asymmetric information, Bestñworst scaling case 3, General practice, User orientation ; asymmetric information, economic theory, experimental study, health worker, heterogeneity, survey, consultation, Danish citizen, doctor patient relation, general practitioner, human, model, motivation, writing, decision making, general practice, general practitioner, patient advocacy, patient preference, patient referral, Denmark, Choice Behavior, Family Practice, General Practice, General Practitioners, Humans, Patient Advocacy, Patient Preference, Referral and Consultation ; 27723469,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84991259688

Methods: Normally standardized distributions of ADL measurements were simulated using item parameters from published papers. We retrieved item parameters of the combined Barthel Index and Frenchay Activities Index from the literature (the 23-item comprehensive ADL [CADL] and 34-item ADL scales) and simulated three 1000-person measures from a normal standard CAT distribution: [i] CADL (CADL-CAT), [ii] ADL (ADL-CAT), and [iii] NAT (Non-Adaptive Testing). The cutpoints of ADL person strata were determined using a norm-reference method. Maximum a posteriori estimation, expected a posteriori estimation, and maximum likelihood estimation (MAP) were used to compare the Pearson correlation coefficients and different number ratios of paired measures yielded by CAT and NAT. The number of items and the cutpoints for the scale were separately determined. Results: We found that (i) correlation coefficients for the three CAT-estimated measures were 0.77 (CADL), 0.93 (Male ADL), and 0.93 (Female ADL) compared with their NAT counterparts. Different number ratios of person-paired measures between CAT and NAT for the three scales were all less than 5 %, indicating no difference exists between CAT and NAT. However, CAT might be 66 % more efficient than NAT. (ii) The estimated cutpoints of T scores (i.e., with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10) were 45, 55, and 65 (e.g., separating person ADL function to four strata with not active, fairly active, active, and very active). (iii) An available-for-download online ADL-CAT APP for clinical practice was demonstrated. Conclusions: An online ADL-CAT APP using the MAP method was created and used on smartphones to classify ADL strata in patients with stroke. © 2016 The Author(s).,,computer simulation, daily life activity, female, human, male, theoretical model, Activities of Daily Living, Computer Simulation, Female, Humans, Male, Models, Theoretical ; 27724939,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84991383821

For the reduction of death rates by earlier identification of carcinogenic areas, mammogram images are utilized. Computer aided diagnosis plays an important role in screening of the mammograms. Mammography is an efficient as well as feasible method for the detection of breast cancers, especially minute tumours. Efficient performance of these tools is dependent on the efficacy of the classifier algorithms. In this work, feature selection techniques are proposed to improve the efficacy of the classifiers. Method: The major phases in diagnosing breast cancers are features extraction and selection. Detecting tumours naturally requires extraction of features as well as their classification. This work uses Pseudo Zernike Moments and Gaussian Markov Random Field (GMRF) for feature extraction, Binary Shuffled frog algorithm, Information Gain (IG) and Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for feature selection and C4.5, Random tree, Adaboost as classifiers. Results: The use of feature selection techniques for successfully selecting relevant feature subset improves the classification performance. The proposed wrapper based Binary Shuffled Frog Algorithm improves the detection of breast cancer mass in mammograms. Conclusion: The work focuses on improving classification performance through feature selection. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed feature selection method. It is observed that the feature selectors are necessary to improve the efficiency of the classifiers. It is observed that among the various classification techniques, C4.5 outperforms other algorithms achieving the highest accuracy. ©2016 Bentham Science Publishers. ; Binary particle swarm optimization, Gaussian Markov random field, Pseudo zernike moments, Shuffled frog algorithm ; Adaboost classifier, Article, Binary Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm, Binary Shuffled frog algorithm, breast cancer, C4.5 classifier, cancer classification, classification algorithm, classifier, clinical effectiveness, decision tree, diagnostic accuracy, digital mammography, fuzzy system, human, image analysis, Information Gain algorithm, Markov chain, priority journal, Pseudo Zernike Moment, Random tree, sensitivity and specificity, stochastic model,,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84995704293

Often this process is stunted by high testing costs associated with evaluating new biomarkers. Traditionally, biomarker assessments are individually tested within a target population. Pooling has been proposed to help alleviate the testing costs, where pools are formed by combining several individual specimens. Methods for using pooled biomarker assessments to estimate discriminatory ability have been developed. However, all these procedures have failed to acknowledge confounding factors. In this paper, we propose a regression methodology based on pooled biomarker measurements that allow the assessment of the discriminatory ability of a biomarker of interest. In particular, we develop covariate-adjusted estimators of the receiver-operating characteristic curve, the area under the curve, and Youden's index. We establish the asymptotic properties of these estimators and develop inferential techniques that allow one to assess whether a biomarker is a good discriminator between cases and controls, while controlling for confounders. The finite sample performance of the proposed methodology is illustrated through simulation. We apply our methods to analyze myocardial infarction (MI) data, with the goal of determining whether the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 is a good predictor of MI after controlling for the subjects' cholesterol levels. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Analyses of these data require new statistical and computational methods. In this article, we propose one such method that is useful in selecting explanatory variables for prediction of a binary response. Although this problem has recently been addressed using penalized likelihood methods, we adopt a Bayesian approach that utilizes a mixture of non-local prior densities and point masses on the binary regression coefficient vectors. Results: The resulting method, which we call iMOMLogit, provides improved performance in identifying true models and reducing estimation and prediction error in a number of simulation studies. More importantly, its application to several genomic datasets produces predictions that have high accuracy using far fewer explanatory variables than competing methods. We also describe a novel approach for setting prior hyperparameters by examining the total variation distance between the prior distributions on the regression parameters and the distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator under the null distribution.

We assessed lifetime sexual trauma histories among 29 homeless women from three Southern California community sites: one residential safe house and two safe parking areas. More than half of the women (54%) reported a history of sexual trauma. That rate was higher (86%) among women living at the safe home than among women staying at the safe parking sites (only 42%). All four of the women who had served in the military reported having experienced military sexual trauma. The high percentages of sexual trauma found in homeless women highlight the need for effective interventions for sexual trauma. © 2016 Taylor & Francis. ; Homeless women, military sexual trauma, sexual trauma ; adult, aged, Article, clinical article, environment, ethnicity, female, homelessness, human, human rights, incidence, life history, military deployment, priority journal, risk factor, sexual abuse, United States, California, child abuse survivor, homeless person, middle aged, psychology, sexual crime, soldier, statistics and numerical data, Adult, Adult Survivors of Child Abuse, Aged, California, Female, Homeless Persons, Humans, Middle Aged, Military Personnel, Sex Offenses, United States ; 26583457,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84961237585

The cohort selected for analysis consists of 127104 people from the most contaminated territories of Bryansk and Orel oblasts affected by the Chernobyl accident. Over the follow-up period 1996-2011, a total of 1164 breast cancer cases were identified as the result of annual compulsory health examination (1110 cases in Bryansk oblast and 54 cases in the Orel oblast). The study showed that the spontaneous cancer incidence of breast cancer among the population of Bryansk and Orel oblasts in the period from 1991 to 2011 was statistically lower (by 8%) than the level of incidence in Russia as a whole. Statistically significant screening effect on breast cancer detection was found in the most contaminated territories of Bryansk and Orel oblasts over the period 2006 to 2011.

In the present work, an attempt was made to generate high-affinity single stranded DNA aptamers that specifically bind to Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) by a modified Systemic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX) procedure with the aid of Immunoaffinity columns. Ten rounds of SELEX and alternating three counter SELEX rounds with a cocktail of related and other mycotoxins were performed to enhance the specificity. Resultant 105 aptamers were clustered into 12 groups according to their primary sequence homology. Candidates with lowest Gibbs free energy (dG value) and unique stem loop structures were selected for further characterization. Aptamers, AFLA5, AFLA53, and AFLA71 exhibiting lower Kd values (50.45 ± 11.06, 48.29 ± 9.45, and 85.02 ± 25.74 nM) were chosen for development of ELONA and determination of purification ability of toxin. The detection limit (LOD) of AFLA5 and AFLA71 was 20 and 40 ng/ml, respectively. HPLC analysis implied that selected aptamers were able to recover and quantify 82.2 to 96.21% (LOQ - 53.74 ng) and 78.3 to 94.22% (LOQ - 66.75 ng) of AFB1 from spiked corn samples, respectively. These findings indicate, immunoaffinity based SELEX can pave an alternative approach to screen aptamers against mycotoxin detection and purification. © 2016 Setlem, Mondal, Ramlal and Kingston. ; Aflatoxin B1, ELONA, G score, Immunoaffinity SELEX, Spiking study ; afla5, afla53, afla71, aflatoxin B1, aptamer, single stranded DNA, unclassified drug, antibody affinity, Article, binding affinity, binding kinetics, concentration (parameters), controlled study, dissociation constant, DNA library, gene sequence, high performance liquid chromatography, limit of detection, maize, molecular cloning, nonhuman, phylogenetic tree, polymerase chain reaction, sensitivity analysis, sequence homology, systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment aptamer technique,,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009179823

This descriptive and cross-sectional study was conducted on a sample of 526 students from first cycle of secondary education, with an age between 12 and 15 years old (M=13.13, SD=.9576). The aim is to define the profile of alcohol and tobacco consumption in adolescents through a regression model, using as instruments the AUDIT and FTND questionnaires. The results established that twofifths of adolescents consume alcohol and most did not show dependence to tobacco. The use of these substances increases with age, but it is not related to gender. Besides this, physical activity can decrease the tobacco consumption. The regression model found that alcohol increases tenfold the probability to consume tobacco, also interacting with high intakes and consumption of illegal drugs. Similarly, alcohol consumption is related to tobacco that acts as a bridge substance, and the influences exerted by peers. © Health and Addictions 2016. ; Adolescence, Alcohol, Physical activity, Tobacco,,,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84995487631

But, in the field of radiation protection, radiation associated with low linear energy transfer has been assigned a radiation weighting factor wR of 1. This value may be suitable for radiation protection but, for risk considerations, it is important to evaluate the potential elevated biological effectiveness of radiation to improve the quality of risk estimates. RBE values between 2 and 3 for tritium are implied by several experimental measurements. Additionally, elevated RBE values have been found for other similar low-energy radiation sources. In this work, RBE values are derived for electrons based upon the fractional deposition of absorbed dose of energies less than a few kiloelectron volts. Using this empirical method, RBE values were also derived for monoenergetic photons and 1070 radionuclides from ICRP Publication 107 for which photons and electrons are the primary emissions. © Oxford University Press 2015.,,radioisotope, electron, human, photon, radiation dose, radiation protection, radiometry, relative biologic effectiveness, Electrons, Humans, Photons, Radiation Dosage, Radiation Protection, Radioisotopes, Radiometry, Relative Biological Effectiveness ; 25636403,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84960121022

Therefore, Switzerland intends to promote MC by forcing health insurers to write MC contracts and introducing budgetary co-responsibility for ambulatory care physicians. A discrete choice experiment conducted in 2011 including 872 physicians reveals a strong preference heterogeneity with respect to network participation and alternative remuneration schemes. The number of physicians working in networks is unlikely to rise on a voluntary basis, while general practitioners are more likely to join networks than specialists with surgical activities. For physicians considering joining networks, cost savings are predicted to be higher than the estimated willingness-to-accept payments. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. ; Discrete choice experiment, Latent-class logit, Managed care, Physician networks, Physician reimbursement ; discrete choice analysis, health care, health worker, logit analysis, voluntary approach, adult, ambulatory care, Article, budget, contract, cost control, female, general practitioner, health care cost, health maintenance organization, human, male, managed care, medical specialist, physician, physician attitude, physician network, remuneration, responsibility, Switzerland, budget, economics, health insurance, medical fee, medicine, middle aged, organization and management, procedures, reimbursement, Switzerland, Budgets, Cost Savings, Fee-for-Service Plans, Female, General Practitioners, Humans, Insurance, Health, Male, Managed Care Programs, Medicine, Middle Aged, Physicians, Reimbursement Mechanisms, Switzerland ; 25637711,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84922070145

The aim of this study was to validate and compare the performance of preoperative risk assessment tools in a population of men treated with radical prostatectomy at a single European institution. Material and methods. Patients were identified from databases of radical prostatectomy between 1996 and 2011 from a single UK centre. Information was obtained on demographics, prostate-specific antigen, staging, biopsy and specimen histopathology, and follow-up. Data were inputted into the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), Partin 1997 and Makarov/Partin 2007 nomograms, and the University of California San Francisco-Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment tool (UCSF-CAPRA). The risks of extracapsular extension (ECE), seminal vesicle invasion (SVI) and lymph-node involvement (LNI) were calculated and compared with known outcomes. Nomogram performance was measured using Hosmer-Lemeshow (HL) goodness-of-fit tests, calculating concordance indices (c-indices) and calibration curves. Results. Data were obtained for 541 patients. Prediction of ECE was relatively poor using all nomograms, with the Makarov/Partin 2007 the most accurate at prediction over the range of risk stratification (HL 9.9, c-index 0.62). Predictions of SVI and LNI were better than for ECE, with the MSKCC nomogram performing best for SVI (HL 10.9, c-index 0.73) and all nomograms performing well for LNI prediction (c-indices 0.8 to 0.815). CAPRA predicted best for SVI (OR 1.49, 95% confidence interval 1.27-1.74). Conclusions. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first head-to-head comparison of the accuracy of these commonly used risk calculators in a North European population. Caution should be used when counselling patients using nomograms. Although nomograms may be used as a guide, patients should be warned that they often have not been validated on different European populations and may give misleading information regarding a patient's specific risks. © 2015 Informa Healthcare. ; Cancer, Nomogram, Prostate ; prostate specific antigen, kallikrein, kallikrein-related peptidase 3, human, prostate specific antigen, accuracy, adult, aged, Article, cancer patient, European, extracapsular extension, Gleason score, human, lymph node dissection, lymph node metastasis, major clinical study, male, nomogram, outcome assessment, preoperative evaluation, prostate cancer, prostatectomy, risk assessment, seminal vesicle invasion, blood, cancer staging, Europe, Great Britain, large core needle biopsy, lymph node, middle aged, pathology, Prostatic Neoplasms, seminal vesicle, validation study, very elderly, Adult, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Biopsy, Large-Core Needle, Europe, Great Britain, Humans, Kallikreins, Lymph Nodes, Male, Middle Aged, Neoplasm Staging, Nomograms, Prostate-Specific Antigen, Prostatectomy, Prostatic Neoplasms, Risk Assessment, Seminal Vesicles ; 24882277,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84920401556

This gave birth to a new data warehouse type called trajectory data warehouse that is essential to model and to implement to analyze and understand the nature and the behavior of movements of objects in various contexts. However, it is still difficult to find references models, since classical conceptual modeling does not incorporate the specificity of trajectory data due to the complexity of their components that are spatial, temporal and thematic (semantic). Motivated by this luck, we propose in this paper a new modeling framework based on an UML profile to support the conceptual modeling or design of data resulting from moving objects. © Springer-Verlag Wien 2015. ; Mobile hospital, Trajectory data modeling, Trajectory data warehouse modeling, Trajectory UML profile ; Data mining, Data warehouses, Hospitals, Semantics, Conceptual model, Model framework, Moving objects, Trajectory data, Uml profiles, Trajectories, Article, biopsy, breast cancer, cancer screening, computer aided design, conceptual framework, data base, genetic screening, hospital management, human, mammography, medical decision making, medical informatics, medical staff, priority journal, rural population, task performance,,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85049114691

Methods: A tissue microarray was performed to simulate the dynamic process of invasion and metastasis of GC. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to detect the expression of CDH17 protein, and PCR-based LDR was performed to detect the 2 SNP loci (rs2514813 and rs3214050) genotypes of CDH17 gene. Results: The expression of CDH17 protein in GC was more significantly up-regulated and greatly increased in the intestinal type than in the diffuse type. The expression of CDH17 protein in GC was positively correlated with the histological grading (P<0.01) and was not associated with the survival (P=0.209). With the progression of the cancer invasion, the expression of CDH17 protein in GC showed a downtrend from the gastric mucosa layer to the invasive front edge. The frequencies of the C and T alleles and the CC, CT, and TT genotypes at the CDH17 rs3214050 locus between the GC patients and the control groups were significantly different (P<0.01). However, no significant differences were observed at rs2514813 (P>0.05). The individuals with the T alleles had longer survival time than those with the CC genotype (P<0.01). Conclusion: The up-regulation of CDH17 expression is involved in the maintenance of histological phenotype and progression of GC. Individuals with T alleles at the CDH17 rs3214050 locus have decreased risk of GC and had better prognosis (OR=0.762, 95%CI:0.619-0.937), thereby suggesting that screening for these alleles would help with the assessment of genetic susceptibility and prognosis of GC in the Fujian population. ; Cadherin-17, Gastric carcinoma, Immunohistochemistry, Invasion, Metastasis, Single nucleotide polymorphism ; allele, Article, cancer growth, cancer survival, carcinogenesis, cdh17 gene, controlled study, gene, gene expression, gene locus, genetic susceptibility, genotype, human, immunohistochemistry, metastasis, simulation, single nucleotide polymorphism, stomach carcinoma, stomach mucosa, tissue microarray, tumor invasion, upregulation,,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019499515

Only a simultaneous assessment of all relevant treatment alternatives avoids comparing average cost-effectiveness ratios and allows a truly incremental analysis. Two issues arise if the analysis is probabilistic, namely, the occurrence of output correlations and difficulty in presenting the results. I have examined the role of output correlations using a screening model with eight alternatives and have shown that specifically costñcost and quality-adjusted life years (QALY)ñQALY correlations between alternatives have a major impact on decision uncertainty, as measured by the probability of the cost-effectiveness and expected value of perfect information. In particular, the latter strongly depends on between-alternative output correlations. This analysis shows that both the expected value of perfect information plots and acceptability curves/frontiers are sensitive to output correlations and thus appropriate for presentation of multiple alternatives. To avoid confusing statistical significance and economic importance I propose that acceptability curves be augmented by incremental net-benefit density plots at a given willingness to pay threshold. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. ; Multiple alternatives, Output correlations, Probabilistic model, Uncertainty analysis ; biomedical technology assessment, cost benefit analysis, procedures, quality adjusted life year, statistical model, Cost-Benefit Analysis, Cost-Benefit Analysis, Cost-Benefit Analysis, Models, Econometric, Models, Econometric, Models, Econometric, Models, Statistical, Models, Statistical, Models, Statistical, Quality-Adjusted Life Years, Quality-Adjusted Life Years, Quality-Adjusted Life Years, Technology Assessment, Biomedical, Technology Assessment, Biomedical, Technology Assessment, Biomedical ; 24390145,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84891382370

We propose to use Cochran's Q test to assess heterogeneity in diagnostic likelihood ratios (LRs). Study Design and Setting We reanalyzed published data of six articles that showed within-study heterogeneity in diagnostic accuracy. We used the Q test to assess heterogeneity in LRs and compared the results of the Q test with those obtained using another method for stratified analysis of LRs, based on subgroup confidence intervals. We also studied the behavior of the Q test using hypothetical data. Results The Q test detected significant heterogeneity in LRs in all six example data sets. The Q test detected significant heterogeneity in LRs more frequently than the confidence interval approach (38% vs. 20%). When applied to hypothetical data, the Q test would be able to detect relatively small variations in LRs, of about a twofold increase, in a study including 300 participants.

The objective of our study was to investigate whether the use of a software- based automated tube potential selection (ATPS) CT neck protocol can result in radiation dose reduction as compared with a set 120-kV protocol without a statistically significant reduction in image quality. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Three hundred sixty-four patients (median age, 52 years) underwent CT of the neck. Group 1 (n = 320) underwent CT with ATPS with 80, 100, or 120 kV. Group 2 (n = 44) was examined with the standard CT protocol at 120 kV. Attenuation, image background noise, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), dose-length product (DLP), volume CT dose index (CTDIvol), body mass index (BMI [weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters]), and subjective image quality (5-point Likert scale, two readers in consensus) were analyzed. RESULTS. A tube potential of 100 kV was selected in 279 patients, 120 kV in 40 patients, and 80 kV in one patient of the ATPS group. A significant correlation was found for selected tube potential and BMI (80 kV, BMI = 20.4, 100 kV, mean BMI = 24.2, 120 kV, BMI = 28.6, r = 0.28, p <0.01). The average radiation dose was significantly lower with ATPS activated than with the standard protocol (mean DLP, 259 vs 350 mGy ? cm, respectively). Background noise did not differ between groups 1 and 2 at the levels of the mandibular angle and the upper mediastinum, however, attenuation and SNR increased significantly with lower tube potential settings. Subjective image quality did not suffer (mean image quality score: ATPS protocol vs standard protocol, 4.56 vs 4.61, respectively, p> 0.05) with good interobserver agreement (?> 0.56). CONCLUSION. ATPS allows significant dose savings for CT of the neck compared with a standard protocol that uses a fixed 120-kV setting without a statistically significant reduction in image quality. © American Roentgen Ray Society. ; Attenuation-based automated tube potential selection, Automated tube potential selection (ATPS), CT, Dose reduction, Neck CT, Radiation exposure ; aged, Article, automated tube potential selection, automation, body mass, cervical spine radiography, child, clinical protocol, computer assisted tomography, contrast enhancement, controlled study, dose length product, dosimetry, human, image analysis, image quality, major clinical study, preschool child, priority journal, radiation dose reduction, radiological parameters, radiological procedures, signal noise ratio, very elderly, volume computed tomography dose index, adolescent, adult, computer assisted tomography, computer program, devices, female, male, middle aged, neck, procedures, radiation dose, radiation protection, radiography, Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Automation, Child, Child, Preschool, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Neck, Radiation Dosage, Radiation Protection, Signal-To-Noise Ratio, Software, Tomography, X-Ray Computed ; 25905940,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84934326074

To mitigate this cost, strategies such as randomly selecting a portion of specimens for analysis or randomly pooling specimens prior to performing laboratory assays may be employed. These techniques, while effective in reducing cost, are often accompanied by a considerable loss of statistical efficiency. We propose a novel pooling strategy based on the k-means clustering algorithm to reduce laboratory costs while maintaining a high level of statistical efficiency when predictor variables are measured on all subjects, but the outcome of interest is assessed in pools. We perform simulations motivated by the BioCycle study to compare this k-means pooling strategy with current pooling and selection techniques under simple and multiple linear regression models. While all of the methods considered produce unbiased estimates and confidence intervals with appropriate coverage, pooling under k-means clustering provides the most precise estimates, closely approximating results from the full data and losing minimal precision as the total number of pools decreases. The benefits of k-means clustering evident in the simulation study are then applied to an analysis of the BioCycle dataset. In conclusion, when the number of lab tests is limited by budget, pooling specimens based on k-means clustering prior to performing lab assays can be an effective way to save money with minimal information loss in a regression setting. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ; -means clustering, Biomarkers, Design, Pooling, Regression analysis ; alpha tocopherol, estradiol, high density lipoprotein, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, algorithm, Article, body mass, cholesterol blood level, confidence interval, cost control, estradiol blood level, human, investigative procedures, k means clustering algorithm, laboratory test, linear regression analysis, measurement precision, multiple linear regression analysis, pooling method, premenopause, regression analysis, simulation, vitamin blood level, cluster analysis, computer simulation, diagnostic test, economics, methodology, procedures, statistical model, Algorithms, Cluster Analysis, Computer Simulation, Diagnostic Tests, Routine, Humans, Linear Models, Research Design ; 25220822,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84908886689

The accuracy of such diagnostic tests is commonly assessed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. To summarize an ROC curve and determine its optimal cut-point, the Youden index is popularly used. In literature, the estimation of the Youden index has been widely studied via various statistical modeling strategies on the conditional density. This paper proposes a new model-free estimation method, which directly estimates the covariate-adjusted cut-point without estimating the conditional density. Consequently, covariate-adjusted Youden index can be estimated based on the estimated cut-point. The proposed method formulates the estimation problem in a large margin classification framework, which allows flexible modeling of the covariate-adjusted Youden index through kernel machines. The advantage of the proposed method is demonstrated in a variety of simulated experiments as well as a real application to Pima Indians diabetes study. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ; Diagnostic accuracy, Margin, Receiver operating characteristic curve, Reproducing kernel Hilbert space, Youden index ; glucose, biological marker, glucose blood level, age, Article, covariate adjusted cut point, diabetes mellitus, diagnostic accuracy, glucose blood level, human, kernel method, oral glucose tolerance test, Pima (people), prediction, receiver operating characteristic, statistical model, statistical parameters, Youden index, American Indian, analysis, blood, computer simulation, diabetes mellitus, diagnostic test, female, glucose tolerance test, male, middle aged, procedures, statistical analysis, Biological Markers, Blood Glucose, Computer Simulation, Data Interpretation, Statistical, Diabetes Mellitus, Diagnostic Tests, Routine, Female, Glucose Tolerance Test, Humans, Indians, North American, Male, Middle Aged ; 25156275,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84908699235

Several factors may influence PDR including time of procedure and order of colonoscopy within a session. Our unit provides evening colonoscopy lists (6-9 pm). We examined whether colonoscopy performance declines in the evening. Design: Data for all National Health Service (NHS) outpatient colonoscopies performed at Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital in 2011 were examined. Timing, demographics, indication and colonoscopy findings were recorded. Statistical analysis was performed using multivariate regression. Results: Data from 2576 colonoscopies were included: 1163 (45.1%) in the morning, 1123 (43.6%) in the afternoon and 290 (11.3%) in the evening. Overall PDR was 40.80%. Males, increasing age and successful caecal intubation were all significantly associated with higher polyp detection. The indications 'faecal occult blood screening' (p<0.001) and 'polyp surveillance' (p<0.001) were strongly positively associated and 'anaemia' (p=0.01) was negatively associated with PDR. Following adjustment for covariates, there was no significant difference in PDR between sessions. With the morning as the reference value, the odds ratio for polyp detection in the afternoon and evening were 0.93 (95% CI = 0.72-1.18) and 1.15 (95%CI = 0.82-1.61) respectively. PDR was not affected by rank of colonoscopy within a list, sedation dose or trainee-involvement. Conclusions: Time of day did not affect polyp detection rate in clinical practice. Evening colonoscopy had equivalent efficacy and is an effective tool in meeting increasing demands for endoscopy. Standardisation was shown to have a considerable effect as demographics, indication and endoscopist varied substantially between sessions.

The measure can be motivated as a special model: the Lehmann model for ROC curves. The Lehmann model involves study-specific sensitivities and specificities and a diagnostic accuracy parameter which connects the two. Methods. A study-specific model is estimated for each study, and the resulting study-specific estimate of diagnostic accuracy is taken as an outcome measure for a mixed model with a random study effect and other study-level covariates as fixed effects. The variance component model becomes estimable by deriving within-study variances, depending on the outcome measure of choice. In contrast to existing approaches - usually of bivariate nature for the outcome measures - the suggested approach is univariate and, hence, allows easily the application of conventional mixed modelling. Results: Some simple modifications in the SAS procedure proc mixed allow the fitting of mixed models for meta-analytic data from diagnostic studies. The methodology is illustrated with several meta-analytic diagnostic data sets, including a meta-analysis of the Mini-Mental State Examination as a diagnostic device for dementia and mild cognitive impairment. Conclusions: The proposed methodology allows us to embed the meta-analysis of diagnostic studies into the well-developed area of mixed modelling. Different outcome measures, specifically from the perspective of whether a local or a global measure of diagnostic accuracy should be applied, are discussed as well. In particular, variation in cut-off value is discussed together with recommendations on choosing the best cut-off value. We also show how this problem can be addressed with the proposed methodology. © 2014 Charoensawat et al., licensee BioMed Central Ltd. ; Cut-off value modelling, Diagnostic accuracy, Mixed modelling, Random effects modelling, SROC modelling ; brain natriuretic peptide, algorithm, dementia, Depressive Disorder, diagnostic error, diagnostic test, heart failure, human, mental health, mild cognitive impairment, outcome assessment, procedures, proportional hazards model, receiver operating characteristic, sensitivity and specificity, statistical model, Algorithms, Dementia, Depressive Disorder, Diagnostic Errors, Diagnostic Tests, Routine, Heart Failure, Humans, Mental Health, Mild Cognitive Impairment, Models, Statistical, Natriuretic Peptide, Brain, Outcome Assessment (Health Care), Proportional Hazards Models, ROC Curve, Sensitivity and Specificity ; 24758534,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84899974484

This study investigated whether substance use among African Americans ages 15 to 25 (M= 18.86. years) living in such areas was related to present-dominated time perspectives and higher delay discounting. Participants (N= 344, 110 males, 234 females) living in Deep South disadvantaged urban neighborhoods were recruited using Respondent Driven Sampling, an improved peer-referral sampling method suitable for accessing this hard-to-reach target group. Structured field interviews assessed alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drug use and risk/protective factors, including time perspectives (Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory [ZTPI]) and behavioral impulsivity (delay discounting task). As predicted, substance use was positively related to a greater ZTPI orientation toward present pleasure and a lower tendency to plan and achieve future goals. Although the sample as a whole showed high discounting of delayed rewards, discount rates did not predict substance use. The findings suggest that interventions to lengthen time perspectives and promote enriched views of future possible selves may prevent and reduce substance use among disadvantaged youths. Discontinuities among the discounting and time perspective variables in relation to substance use merit further investigation. © 2013. ; African Americans, Delay discounting, Emerging adulthood, Respondent driven sampling, Substance use, Time perspectives ; African Americans, Delay discounting, Emerging adulthood, Respondent driven sampling, Substance use, Time perspectives, Adolescent, Adolescent Development, Adult, African Americans, Alabama, Female, Humans, Impulsive Behavior, Interview, Psychological, Male, Models, Statistical, Personality Inventory, Poverty Areas, Reward, Risk-Taking, Substance-Related Disorders, Time Perception, Urban Population, Young Adult ; 24531637,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84894092331

Computational tools play a critical role in identifying potential active sites and informing screening decisions for further lab analysis. A critical parameter in the practical application of computational methods is the precision, or positive predictive value. Precision measures the level of confidence the user should have in a particular computed functional assignment. Low precision annotations lead to futile laboratory investigations and waste scarce research resources. In this paper we describe an advanced version of the protein function annotation system FEATURE, which achieved 99% precision and average recall of 95% across 20 representative functional sites. The system uses a Support Vector Machine classifier operating on the microenvironment of physicochemical features around an amino acid. We also compared performance of our method with state-of-the-art sequence-level annotator Pfam in terms of precision, recall and localization. To our knowledge, no other functional site annotator has been rigorously evaluated against these key criteria.

Design Secondary analysis of biomarker data using multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), a supervised machine learning algorithm method. Setting Analysis of data on 36 biomarkers from 191 women was reduced by MARS to develop predictive models for preterm birth in African Americans and Caucasians. Samples Maternal plasma, cord plasma collected at admission for preterm or term labor and amniotic fluid at delivery. Methods Data were partitioned into training and testing sets. Variable importance, a relative indicator (0-100%) and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) characterized results. Results Multivariate adaptive regression splines generated models for combined and racially stratified biomarker data. Clinical and demographic data did not contribute to the model. Racial stratification of data produced distinct models in all three compartments. In African Americans maternal plasma samples IL-1RA, TNF-?, angiopoietin 2, TNFRI, IL-5, MIP1?, IL-1? and TGF-? modeled preterm birth (AUC train: 0.98, AUC test: 0.86). In Caucasians TNFR1, ICAM-1 and IL-1RA contributed to the model (AUC train: 0.84, AUC test: 0.68). African Americans cord plasma samples produced IL-12P70, IL-8 (AUC train: 0.82, AUC test: 0.66). Cord plasma in Caucasians modeled IGFII, PDGFBB, TGF-?1, IL-12P70, and TIMP1 (AUC train: 0.99, AUC test: 0.82).

Heart disease (HD) has gained special attention in medical studies. Recently studying on classification and diagnosis of HD as a key topic and a lot of researches have been done in order to increase precise and reduce error in this type of decisions. With development of intelligent learning systems, these systems have played a great role in reducing the error of decision support systems (DSS). Materials and methods: In this study, a simple hybrid model of logistic regression and single-layer perceptron neural network was presented which was trained with four-different learning rules (separately). The model for improving the classification and patterns recognition of HD has been used on clinical data of 270 patients from the Cleveland Clinic (UCI website). This method has been used in statistical data normalization and detection of noisy data, network training with only 20% of the data exist was performed. The model has been implemented in MATLAB. Results: The mean-error of the proposed model on the total dataset was 11.11%, which was achieved a significant improvement compared to recent similar methods. In addition, the results showed that the proposed approach was very capable in dealing with noise in the data. Conclusion: The results clearly showed that the linear proposed technique had large impact on reducing the error in the classification and identification of patients more accurately in a shorter time than conventional methods and complex nonlinear. The method can help physicians for early detection of disease or as a DSS. ; Artificial neural network, Biomedical engineering, Heart diseases diagnosis, Logistic regression, Machine learning, Pattern recognition, Single layer perceptron ; article, artificial neural network, computer program, data analysis, disease classification, heart disease, human, logistic regression analysis, major clinical study, perceptron, statistical analysis,,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84940338816

The purpose of this study was to explore the possibility of decreasing false-positive signals of disproportionate reporting (SDR) by calculating the proportional reporting ratio (PRR)-by-therapeutic area (TA), while still maintaining the ability to detect relevant SDRs. Methods: In the EudraVigilance (EV) Database, output from PRR calculated with a restricted TA comparator background was compared in detail to output from conventional authority-setting PRR calculations for four drugs: bicalutamide, abiraterone, metformin, and vildagliptin, within the TAs of prostate gland disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Results: ADR reports per investigated drug ranged from 2,400 to 50,000. The PRR-TA's ability to detect true-positive SDRs (as acknowledged in approved labeling) was increased compared to the conventional PRR, and performed 8-31 % better than a recently proposed stricter EU-SDR definition. The PRR-TA removed false SDRs confounded by disease or disease spill-over by up to 63 %, while retaining/increasing the number of unclassified SDRs relevant for manual validation, and thereby improving the ratio between confounded SDRs (i.e., noise) and unclassified SDRs for all investigated drugs (possible signals). Conclusions: The performance of the PRR was improved by background restriction with the PRR-TA method, the number of false-positive SDRs decreased, and the ability to detect true-positive SDRs increased, improving the signal-to-noise ratio. Further development and validation of the method is needed within other TAs and databases, and for disproportionality analysis methods. © 2014 The Author(s). ; ADR, Adverse drug reactions, Disproportionality analysis, Pharmacovigilance, PRR, Signal detection ; abiraterone, bicalutamide, metformin, vildagliptin, antiandrogen, antidiabetic agent, adverse drug reaction, article, data base, drug indication, drug surveillance program, human, male, noise reduction, non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, pilot study, predictive value, priority journal, prostate hypertrophy, sensitivity and specificity, signal detection, signal noise ratio, drug surveillance program, Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions, European Union, factual database, laboratory diagnosis, standards, statistical model, statistics and numerical data, Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems, Androgen Antagonists, Databases, Factual, Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions, European Union, False Positive Reactions, Humans, Hypoglycemic Agents, Models, Statistical, Pharmacovigilance, Pilot Projects ; 24599513,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84898882465

A two-stage approach by self-organizing maps and K-means method is applied to segment 1,462 patients into twelve clusters. The average values of L, R, and F excluding monetary covered by national health insurance program are computed for each cluster. In addition, customer value matrix is used to analyze customer values of twelve clusters in terms of frequency and monetary. Customer relationship matrix considering length and recency is also applied to classify different types of customers from these twelve clusters. The results show that three clusters can be classified into loyal patients with L, R, and F values greater than the respective average L, R, and F values, while three clusters can be viewed as lost patients without any variable above the average values of L, R, and F. When different types of patients are identified, marketing strategies can be designed to meet different patients' needs. © 2014 Hsin-Hung Wu et al.,,adolescent, analytic method, article, child, cluster analysis, dental clinic, female, health care need, human, length, recency, frequency, and monetary model, major clinical study, male, national health insurance, pediatric hospital, personal value, recency, frequency, and monetary model, social marketing, Taiwan, infant, preschool child, theoretical model, Adolescent, Child, Child, Preschool, Cluster Analysis, Dental Clinics, Humans, Infant, Models, Theoretical, Taiwan ; 25045741,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84904131215

On the other hand, the nanoporation process itself in these micro floudic devices is relatively complex and more sophisticated. The microfloudic device with complete smart control over the that process as well as cell debris separation and subsequent intracellular cell content analysis have not been reported yet. Therefore, it is expected that integrated devices where combinations of nanoporation, separation and analysis occur will emerge, such as devices with integrated chromatography, electrophoresis or isoelectric focusing steps for separation, and mass spectroscopic, electrochemical and fluorescent methods for analysis. Secondly, the present designs usually require multiple manual steps in order to insert the cells, electroporation them and measure the effects. Until now, no devices have been reported where all of these steps have been integrated in an automated way, preferably with multiple parallel samples, which could greatly enhance the application of micro technological analysis and drug delivery system. This research presents the numerical and experimental study of intra organelle nano poration of multi layer osteoblast cell placed in a 3D non uniform advanced microfloudic chip composed of bi metallic heterogeneous micro electrode under the influences of smart control FPGA based pico pulse generator along with cell trapping and separation and images of intra organelle nanoporation are recognized by neural fuzzy network. The complete design of the micro chip is thoroughly analytically and numerically explained. It is observed that at the time of the micro pulse is applied the cell starts to response but it is unable to penetrate the intra cellular nucleus-membrane where as the expected results will come when the Pico pulse is applied on the cell, a number of nana pores are generated on the intra organelle and chemicals are entered into the cell. It is also exposed that the key parameter of nanoporation such as intra organelle voltage, pore radius, pore density, pressure, surface tension and ion uptake are externally controlled by user defined hybrid 3D micro chip and FPGA based pico pulse generator. The mechanism for osteoblast cell trapping and cell separation are logically explain and verified. The application of neural fuzzy network for succesfull reorganization of nanoporative image is completely explore. © 2014 American Scientific Publishers.

The Swedish wild boar population is expanding and increased hunting provides its meat to a growing group of consumers. We performed a spatio-temporal investigation of T. gondii seroprevalence in Swedish wild boars. An ELISA was set up and evaluated against a commercial direct agglutination test, using Bayesian latent class analysis. The ELISA sensitivity and specificity were estimated to 79% and 85%, respectively. Of 1327 serum samples, 50% were positive. Thirty-four per cent of young wild boars and 55% of adults were positive (P < 0∑001). The total seroprevalence ranged from 72% in 2005 to 38% in 2011 (P < 0∑001), suggesting a declining trend. The highest seroprevalence, 65%, was recorded in South Sweden. In other regions it varied from 29% in Stockholm to 46% in East Middle Sweden.

Instant study also elaborates molecular interaction studies of 3-aminomethyl-1,2-dihydro-4-phenyl-1-isoquinolones derivatives on maestro 8.5 workstation. The 3D-QSAR study comprises, four point pharmacophore features (APRR.9), including one hydrogen bond acceptor (A), one Positive (P) and two aromatic ring (R) with discrete geometries. The developed pharmacophore features were used to derive a predictive atom-based 3D QSAR model. Thus obtained 3D QSAR model has an excellent regression coefficient value (r2=0.9707) along with good statistical significance as shown by high Fisher ratio (F=215). The model also exhibits good predictive power, which is confirmed by high value of cross validated correlation coefficient (q2 = 0.901). The instant studied QSAR model suggests that hydrogen bond acceptor and aromatic character features are crucial for the DPP-IV inhibitory activity. The QSAR model also suggests that the inclusion of hydrophobic substituents, would enhance the DPP-IV inhibition. In addition to the hydrogen bond acceptor, hydrophobic character, electron withdrawing character features positively contribute to the DPP-IV inhibition. © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers. ; 3-amino-4-(2-cyanopyrrolidide)pyrrolidinyl analogs, Docking, DPP-IV inhibitors, Maestro, Optimum polarized ligand simulation-2005 (OPLS-2005), Pharmacophore, PHASE, QSAR, Schrodinger ; 3 aminomethyl 1,2 dihydro 4 phenyl 1 isoquinolone derivative, dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor, isoquinoline derivative, unclassified drug, article, computer program, hydrogen bond, IC 50, molecular docking, molecular interaction, pharmacophore, process design, process optimization, quantitative structure activity relation, regression analysis, theory validation, validation process, variance,,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84890852341

In the United Kingdom (UK) health and social care services are now committed to involving patients and service users in the planning, development and evaluation of their services. Many funders require PPI as a prerequisite for funding. What does healthcare operational research miss by not involving patients and the public in the development, refinement and implementation of models? We believe PPI is important for healthcare OR for model design and validation, and ethical and economic reasons. It also has a distinct contribution that goes beyond the incorporation of behavioural parameters into models. Case studies in neonatal care and a fractured neck of femur pathway highlight PPI's contribution to model design and validation, but a recent conference session also identified a number of obstacles. We suggest a provisional model for the implementation of PPI in healthcare OR that emphasises a facilitative approach. We acknowledge this is a significant challenge, but argue that it must be met for ethical and economic reasons that are ultimately rooted in modellers' construction of valid models. Crucially, it has the potential to enhance our ability to bring about change which can benefit health services and, most importantly, the patients they serve. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. ; Facilitative modelling, Implementation, Modelling process, Patient and public involvement, Problem structuring,,,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84888035816

Identifying which individuals will require more resources and the moment in their lives these resources have to be allocated becomes essential. It is well known that a small number of individuals with complex healthcare needs consume a high percentage of health expenditures. Conversely, little is known on how morbidity evolves throughout life. The aim of this study is to introduce a longitudinal perspective to chronic disease management. Methods. Data used relate to the population of the county of Baix Emporda in Catalonia for the period 2004-2007 (average population was N = 88,858). The database included individual information on morbidity, resource consumption, costs and activity records. The population was classified using the Clinical Risk Groups (CRG) model. Future morbidity evolution was simulated under different assumptions using a stationary Markov chain. We obtained morbidity patterns for the lifetime and the distribution function of the random variable lifetime costs. Individual information on acute episodes, chronic conditions and multimorbidity patterns were included in the model. Results: The probability of having a specific health status in the future (healthy, acute process or different combinations of chronic illness) and the distribution function of healthcare costs for the individual lifetime were obtained for the sample population. The mean lifetime cost for women was 111,936, a third higher than for men, at 81,566 (all amounts calculated in 2007 Euros). Healthy life expectancy at birth for females was 46.99, lower than for males (50.22). Females also spent 28.41 years of life suffering from some type of chronic disease, a longer period than men (21.9). Conclusions: Future morbidity and whole population costs can be reasonably predicted, combining stochastic microsimulation with a morbidity classification system. Potential ways of efficiency arose by introducing a time perspective to chronic disease management. © 2013 Carreras et al., licensee BioMed Central Ltd. ; Chronic disease, Clinical Risk Groups, Lifetime healthcare costs, Markov Chain ; adolescent, age, aged, article, child, chronic disease, economics, female, health care cost, human, infant, life expectancy, male, middle aged, Monte Carlo method, morbidity, newborn, preschool child, probability, sex difference, Spain, statistical model, statistics, very elderly, young adult, Adolescent, Age Factors, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Child, Child, Preschool, Chronic Disease, Female, Health Care Costs, Humans, Infant, Infant, Newborn, Life Expectancy, Male, Markov Chains, Middle Aged, Models, Statistical, Monte Carlo Method, Morbidity, Sex Factors, Spain, Young Adult ; 24156613,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84886124289

Objectives: The pilot study reported here aimed to a) analyze students' understanding of and sensitivity to issues of health literacy, (b) identify students' perceptions of structural, organizational, and political barriers to the promotion of health literacy in social and health care organizations, and (c) document students' suggestions for curriculum changes that would develop their skills and competencies as health-literacy promoters. Design: A qualitative pilot study. Setting: A collaborative undergraduate nursing degree program in the metropolitan area of Toronto, Canada. Participants: Sixteen undergraduate, Year 4 nursing students. Methods: Signed informed consent was obtained from the participants. Participation was unpaid and voluntary. Recruitment was through an email invitation sent by the School of Nursing Student Affairs Coordinator. Three, one-time individual interviews and three focus groups were conducted. All were audio-recorded. Recordings were transcribed, and the transcriptions were coded using the qualitative software ATLAS ti 6.0. The interview data were submitted to thematic analysis. Additional data were gathered from the two-page self-assessments in students' academic portfolios. Results: Sensitivity to health literacy was documented. Students performed best as health promoters in supportive teaching hospitals. Their performance was hindered by clinical settings unsupportive of health education, absence of role models, and insufficient theoretical preparation for health teaching. Students' sensitivity to their clients' diversity reportedly reinforced the interconnection, in multicultural healthcare settings, between health literacy and other social determinants of health and a growing demand for educating future nurses in expanding their role also as health promoters. Conclusions: Students recommended more socially inclusive and experiential learning initiatives related to health teaching to address education gaps in classrooms and practice. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. ; Canada, Health educator, Health literacy promotion, Undergraduate nursing students ; Canada, cultural anthropology, female, health literacy, health personnel attitude, health promotion, human, male, nursing education, nursing student, patient education, pilot study, procedures, psychology, qualitative research, teaching hospital, Attitude of Health Personnel, Canada, Cultural Diversity, Education, Nursing, Baccalaureate, Female, Health Literacy, Health Promotion, Hospitals, Teaching, Humans, Male, Patient Education as Topic, Pilot Projects, Qualitative Research, Students, Nursing ; 22683253,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84883463415

Methods: We searched MEDLINE for manuscripts published between January 1948 and August 2011 that included terms related to FDA, regulatory actions, and empirical evaluation, the review additionally included FDA-identified literature. We used a modified Delphi method to identify preferred methodologies. We included studies with explicit methods to address threats to validity and identified designs and analytic methods with strong internal validity that have been applied to other policy evaluations. Results: We included 18 studies out of 243 abstracts and papers screened. Overall, analytic rigor in prior evaluations of FDA regulatory actions varied considerably, less than a quarter of studies (22%) included control groups. Only 56% assessed changes in the use of substitute products/services, and 11% examined patient health outcomes. Among studies meeting minimal criteria of rigor, 50% found no impact or weak/modest impacts of FDA actions and 33% detected unintended consequences. Among those studies finding significant intended effects of FDA actions, all cited the importance of intensive communication efforts. There are preferred methods with strong internal validity that have yet to be applied to evaluations of FDA regulatory actions. Conclusions: Rigorous evaluations of the impact of FDA regulatory actions have been limited and infrequent. Several methods with strong internal validity are available to improve trustworthiness of future evaluations of FDA policies. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.. ; Evaluation methodology, FDA, Pharmacoepidemiology, Regulatory actions ; article, control group, Delphi study, food and drug administration, health care policy, internal validity, Medline, methodology, priority journal, evaluation methodology, FDA, pharmacoepidemiology, regulatory actions, Consumer Product Safety, Drug Approval, Drug Labeling, Endpoint Determination, Government Regulation, Research Design, United States, United States Food and Drug Administration ; 23847020,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84882587174

This decision rule could be used after initial PC screening, providing the patient and clinician information to consider prior to biopsy. This case-control study evaluated men from the Tampa, Florida, James A. Haley (JH) Veteran's Administration (VA) (N = 1,378), from January 1, 1998, through April 15, 2005. To assess the PBCDR we did all of the following: 1) Identified biomarkers that are related to PC and have the capability of improving the efficiency of PC screening, 2) Developed statistical models to determine which can best predict the probability of PC, 3) Compared each potential model to PSA alone using Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves, to evaluate for improved overall effectiveness in PC detection and reduction in (negative) biopsies, and 4) Evaluated dose-response relationships between specified lab biomarkers (surrogates for extra-prostatic disease development) and PC progression. The following biomarkers were related to PC: hemoglobin (HGB) (OR = 1.42 95% CI 1.27, 1.59), red blood cell (RBC) count (OR = 2.52 95% CI 1.67, 3.78), PSA (OR = 1.04 95% CI 1.03, 1.05), and, creatinine (OR = 1.55 95% CI 1.12, 2.15). Comparing all PC stages versus non-cancerous conditions, the ROC curve area under the curve (AUC) enlarged (increasing the probability of correctly classifying PC): PSA (alone) 0.59 (95% CI 0.55, 0.61), PBCDR model 0.68 (95% CI 0.65, 0.71), and the positive predictive value (PPV) increased: PSA 44.7%, PBCDR model 61.8%. Comparing PC (stages II, III, IV) vs. other, the ROC AUC increased: PSA (alone) 0.63 (95% CI 0.58, 0.66), PBCDR model 0.72 (95% CI 0.68, 0.75), and the PPV increased: 20.6% (PSA), PBCDR model 55.3%. These results suggest evaluating certain common biomarkers in conjunction with PSA may improve PC prediction prior to biopsy. Moreover, these biomarkers may be more helpful in detecting clinically relevant PC.

Aim: The purpose of this study was to quantify the reliability of the ADR as a quality marker. Methods: We simulated a population of endoscopists and patients using published data on adenoma prevalence and adenoma miss rates. For each endoscopist, the ADR was calculated. The proportion of ADR variance attributable to endoscopist and the area under the ROC (AUROC) curve for low-performing endoscopists (lowest quartile or decile) were also calculated. Results: In the base-case analysis (200 patients per endoscopist, miss rate 22 %, adenoma prevalence 24 %), only 13 % of ADR variance was attributable to endoscopist performance (AUROC up to 0.73). An ADR cutoff of <16.5 % identified approximately half of endoscopists in the lowest performance decile (test sensitivity = 53 %), but most (79 %) of the endoscopists identified by this cutoff were NOT low performers (i.e., false positives). In sensitivity analysis, increasing the number of patients per endoscopist, reducing the variance of adenoma prevalence between endoscopists (i.e., performing case-mix adjustment), and increasing the variance in performance between endoscopists all improved ADR test characteristics (AUROC up to 0.88). However, regardless of assumptions, a substantial proportion of endoscopists would be misclassified if a simple ADR cutoff were utilized. Conclusions: The ADR has limited reliability as a quality marker under real-world assumptions. Simple cutoffs are likely to either be insufficiently sensitive or have high false positive rates. Future studies should identify alternative means for assessing endoscopist performance. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York (Outside the USA). ; Adenoma detection rate, Colonoscopy, Quality improvement ; adenomatous polyp, article, cancer diagnosis, clinical practice, colonoscopy, colorectal adenoma, computed tomographic colonography, endoscopy, human, major clinical study, population, prevalence, priority journal, quality control, reliability, retrospective study, sensitivity analysis, Adenoma, Colonoscopy, Colorectal Neoplasms, Computer Simulation, False Positive Reactions, Humans, Models, Theoretical, Quality Indicators, Health Care, Reproducibility of Results, ROC Curve ; 23456494,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84879838849

To develop the Pharmacy-Based Disease Indicator (PBDI), and to evaluate its performance versus the diagnosis-based Deyo version of the Charlson Index in predicting subsequent-year hospitalization in adults. Design. Retrospective cohort analysis. Data Source. Longitudinal health insurance database derived from the national health insurance system in Taiwan. Patients. Two adult populations were identified: 697,823 individuals who were at least 18 years of age on January 1, 2005 (dataset 2005), and 714,072 who were at least 18 years of age on January 1, 2006 (dataset 2006). Measurements and Main Results. Based on the Chronic Disease Score framework and the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system, we developed the PBDI, a comorbidity measure that is a function of 37 drug categories that correspond to major diseases in Taiwan. The relationship between individuals' PBDI score and subsequent-year hospitalization was evaluated by use of logistic regression models. Covariates in the models included age group, sex, PBDI score, and Deyo score. Using the two overlapping adult populations, we calculated both the PBDI score and the Deyo score for each individual in each year. Using subsequent-year hospitalization as the outcome and each comorbidity measure as the predictor, we demonstrated that the c statistic of the PBDI versus the Deyo version of the Charlson Index was 0.72 versus 0.69 for both the 2005 and 2006 populations. The Akaike information criterion, Bayesian information criterion, model calibration, and reclassification measures also confirmed the utility of the PBDI. Conclusion. The PBDI demonstrated acceptable predictive performance for subsequent-year hospitalization. It can be used as a general comorbidity measure to describe the health status of populations based on data derived from population-based automated health care databases. ; Charlson index, Chronic disease score (CDS), Comorbidity measures, Health insurance claims database, Health services research, Pharmacoepidemiology ; adult, aged, article, automation, calibration, Charlson Comorbidity Index, classification, clinical indicator, cohort analysis, comorbidity, data base, female, health care, health insurance, hospitalization, human, major clinical study, male, pharmacy, Pharmacy Based Disease Indicator, retrospective study, scoring system, Taiwan, validation process, Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Cohort Studies, Comorbidity, Databases, Factual, Delivery of Health Care, Female, Hospitalization, Humans, Longitudinal Studies, Male, Middle Aged, National Health Programs, Pharmacy, Population Surveillance, Program Development, Retrospective Studies, Taiwan, Young Adult ; 23386595,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84875419035

Most established tools are also either too burdensome or too imprecise to be used in clinical practice. Item Response Theory (IRT) methods and Computer Adaptive Tests (CAT) promise to overcome these shortcomings. Simulation studies have shown that individually tailored CATs can provide more precise and less burdensome measurements over a larger measurement range than static tools. Several studies with real CAT application have supported the psychometric superiority of CATs, but results from longitudinal studies are still scarce. IRT item banks also allow scoring different established tools measuring the same construct on one common metric, which could greatly facilitate the harmonization of PRO-assessments. ; computerized adaptive test, item bank, item response theory, psychometrics, standardization ; accuracy, article, clinical practice, computerized adaptive testing, human, measurement, medicine, priority journal, psychometry, scoring system, simulation, Adult, Aged, Computers, Female, Humans, Male, Mental Disorders, Middle Aged, Patient Outcome Assessment, Patient-Centered Care, Psychometrics, Psychotherapy, Software, Treatment Outcome, Young Adult ; 23341114,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84872527349

Women over 65 who develop breast cancer bear the heaviest burden of overdiagnosis. This work introduces novel machine learning algorithms to improve diagnostic accuracy of breast cancer in aging populations. At the same time, we aim at minimizing unnecessary invasive procedures (thus decreasing false positives) and concomitantly addressing overdiagnosis. We develop a novel algorithm. Logical Differential Prediction Bayes Net (LDP-BN), that calculates the risk of breast disease based on mammography findings. LDP-BN uses Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) to learn relational rules, selects older-specific differentially predictive rules, and incorporates them into a Bayes Net, significantly improving its performance. In addition, LDP-BN offers valuable insight into the classification process, revealing novel older-specific rules that link mass presence to invasive, and calcification presence and lack of detectable mass to DCIS.,,aged, algorithm, article, artificial intelligence, Bayes theorem, breast tumor, diagnostic error, female, human, intraductal carcinoma, logic, mammography, radiography, Aged, Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence, Bayes Theorem, Breast Neoplasms, Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating, Diagnostic Errors, Female, Humans, Logic, Mammography ; 23304412,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84880805933

Previous econometric studies of specialty choice from the US suggest that although income plays a role, other non-pecuniary factors may be important. This paper presents a novel application of a choice experiment to identify the effects of expected future earnings and other attributes on specialty choice. We find the implied marginal wage estimated from our discrete choice model is close to the actual wages of senior specialists, but much higher than those of senior GPs. In a policy simulation we find that increasing GPs' earnings by $50,000, or increasing opportunities for procedural or academic work can increase the number of junior doctors choosing general practice by between 8 and 13 percentage points. The simulation implies an earnings elasticity of specialty choice of 0.95. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. ; Discrete choice experiment, Junior doctors, Specialty choice ; discrete choice analysis, econometrics, income, preference behavior, wage, article, decision making, economic aspect, general practitioner, health care quality, health care system, health economics, health maintenance organization, human, mathematical analysis, medical education, medical personnel, medical practice, medical specialist, physician, resident, rural area, urban area, workload, Adult, Australia, Career Choice, Computer Simulation, Female, General Practitioners, Health Policy, Humans, Male, Models, Psychological, Physicians, Salaries and Fringe Benefits, Specialization, United States ; 22940638,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865514801

Trajectories and predictors of the course of mental health after spinal cord injury. Objective: To study the course and predictors of mental health in the period between the start of active spinal cord injury (SCI) rehabilitation and 5 years after discharge. The hypothesis was that different mental health trajectories would be identified. Design: Multicenter prospective cohort study with measurements at the start of active rehabilitation, after 3 months, at discharge, 1, 2, and 5 years after discharge. Setting: Eight Dutch rehabilitation centers with specialized SCI units. Participants: Persons (N=206) with recently acquired SCI aged between 18 and 65 years. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measure: The 5-item Mental Health Index with a total score between 0 (lowest mental health) and 100 (highest mental health). Results: Levels of mental health increased between the start of active rehabilitation and 3 months later, remained stable thereafter, and increased again between 2 and 5 years after discharge. Latent class growth mixture modeling revealed 5 trajectories: (1) high scores (above 80) at all time-points (52%), (2) low scores (?60) at all time-points (4%), (3) early recovery from 40 to scores above 70 (13%), (4) intermediate scores from 60 to scores above 70 (29%), and (5) severe deterioration of scores above 70 to scores below 30 (2%). Pain, sex, and education level were predictors to distinguish between the 5 trajectories. Conclusions: Five different mental health trajectories were identified between the start of active rehabilitation and 5 years after discharge. About one third of the persons with SCI still perceived moderate to severe mental health problems 5 years after discharge. Pain, sex, and education level only predicted a small part of the variance in mental health trajectories. © 2012 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine. ; Mental health, Rehabilitation, Spinal cord injuries ; adult, article, educational status, female, human, illness trajectory, injury severity, major clinical study, male, mental health, multicenter study, pain assessment, rehabilitation care, sex difference, social support, spinal cord injury, Adult, Chronic Pain, Female, Humans, Male, Mental Health, Middle Aged, Netherlands, Prospective Studies, Rehabilitation Centers, Sex Factors, Social Support, Socioeconomic Factors, Spinal Cord Injuries, Time Factors, Trauma Severity Indices ; 22835856,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84869491822

We first screen candidates RFs in a Cox Model, and assuming piecewise constant hazards, use pooled logistic regression to model the probability of death as a function of combinations of selected RFs. We average the iterative differencing of the attributable fractions calculated for all overlapping subsets of co-occurring RFs to obtain a LE-AAF for each RF that is additive and symmetrical. We illustrate by partitioning the additive proportions of death from 10 different groupings of acute and chronic diseases, on a national sample of older persons from the US (Medicare Beneficiary Survey) over a 4-year period and compare with results reported by the National Center for Healthcare Statistics. We conclude that careful screening of RFs with analysis restricted to extant combinations greatly reduces computational burden. LE-AAF accounted for a cumulative total of 66% of the deaths in our sample, compared with the 83% accounted for by the National Center for Healthcare Statistics. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ; Average attributable fraction, Cause of death, Cox regression, High dimension, Logistic regression, Medicare ; acute disease, article, attributable fraction, averaging, calculation, chronic disease, controlled study, death, health statistics, logistic regression analysis, mathematical computing, medicare, probability, proportional hazards model, sample (statistics), statistical concepts, Chronic Disease, Data Interpretation, Statistical, Humans, Longitudinal Studies, Medicare, Models, Statistical, Risk Factors, United States ; 22415597,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84869079378

Some were also exposed to radioiodines through inhalation or ingestion. A collaborative case-control study nested within cohorts of Belarusian, Russian and Baltic liquidators was conducted to evaluate the radiation-induced risk of thyroid cancer. The study included 107 cases and 423 controls. Individual doses to the thyroid from external radiation and from iodine-131 (131I) were estimated for each subject. Most subjects received low doses (median 69 mGy). A statistically significant dose-response relationship was found with total thyroid dose. The Excess Relative Risk (ERR) per 100 mGy was 0.38 95 confidence interval (CI): 0.10, 1.09. The risk estimates were similar when doses from 131I and external radiation were considered separately, although for external radiation the ERR was not statistically significantly elevated. The ERR was similar for micro carcinomas and larger size tumors, and for tumors with and without lymph node involvement. Although recall bias and uncertainties in doses could have affected the magnitude of the risk estimates, the findings of this study contribute to a better characterization the risk of thyroid cancer after radiation exposure in adulthood. © 2012 by Radiation Research Society.

Objective: To develop the Numeracy Understanding in Medicine Instrument (NUMi) using item response theory scaling methods. Design: A 20-item test was formed drawing from an item bank of numeracy questions. Items were calibrated using responses from 1000 participants and a 2-parameter item response theory model. Construct validity was assessed by comparing scores on the NUMi to established measures of print and numeric health literacy, mathematic achievement, and cognitive aptitude. Participants: Community and clinical populations in the Milwaukee and Chicago metropolitan areas. Results: Twenty-nine percent of the 1000 respondents were Hispanic, 24% were non-Hispanic white, and 42% were non-Hispanic black. Forty-one percent had no more than a high school education. The mean score on the NUMi was 13.2 (s = 4.6) with a Cronbach of 0.86. Difficulty and discrimination item response theory parameters of the 20 items ranged from 1.70 to 1.45 and 0.39 to 1.98, respectively. Performance on the NUMi was strongly correlated with the Wide Range Achievement Test-Arithmetic (0.73, P < 0.001), the Lipkus Expanded Numeracy Scale (0.69, P < 0.001), the Medical Data Interpretation Test (0.75, P < 0.001), and the Wonderlic Cognitive Ability Test (0.82, P < 0.001). Performance was moderately correlated to the Short Test of Functional Health Literacy (0.43, P < 0.001). Limitations: The NUMi was found to be most discriminating among respondents with a lower-than-average level of health numeracy. Conclusions: The NUMi can be applied in research and clinical settings as a robust measure of the health numeracy construct. ; decision aids, health literacy, risk communication, risk perception, shared decision making ; article, health literacy, human, mathematics, Health Literacy, Humans, Mathematics ; 22635285,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84870573879

SISCOLO has the exam as the unit of observation and the women are not uniquely identified. It has two main tables: histology and cytology, containing the histological and cytological examinations of women, respectively. In this study, data from June 2006 to December 2009 were used. Each table was linked with itself and with the other through record linkage methods. The integration identified 6236 women in the histology table and 1,678,993 in the cytology table. 5324 women from the histology table had records in the cytology table. The sensitivities were above 90% and the specificities and precisions near 100%. This study showed that it is possible to integrate SISCOLO to produce indicators for the evaluation of the cervical cancer screening programme taking the woman as the unit of observation. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. ; Cervical cancer, Database integration, Public health information systems, Record linkage ; Cervical cancers, Database integration, Health information systems, Record linkage, Cytology, Histology, Data handling, accuracy, article, brazilian cervical cancer information system, cancer screening, cytology, data base, female, histology, human, medical information system, medical record, sensitivity and specificity, uterine cervix cancer, Female, Humans, Mass Screening, Medical Record Linkage, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms ; 22341207,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865712256

The temporal relationship between the two variables is unclear. We investigated the prospective bi-directional relationship between smoking and mental health over 13 years.Method Participants were a randomly selected community sample of 10 012 young women with no experience of pregnancy, aged 18-23 years at baseline (1996) from the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health. Follow-up surveys over 13 years were completed in 2000, 2003, 2006 and 2009, allowing for five waves of data. Measures included self-reported smoking and mental health measured by the Mental Health Index from the 36-item short-form health questionnaire and the 10-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Sociodemographic control variables included marital status, education level and employment status.Results A strong cross-sectional dose-response relationship between smoking and poor mental health was found at each wave [odds ratio (OR) 1.41, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.17-1.70 to OR 2.27, 95% CI 1.82-2.81]. Longitudinal results showed that women who smoked had 1.21 (95% CI 1.06-1.39) to 1.62 (95% CI 1.24-2.11) times higher odds of having poor mental health at subsequent waves. Women with poor mental health had 1.12 (95% CI 1.17-1.20) to 2.11 (95% CI 1.68-2.65) times higher odds of smoking at subsequent waves. These results held after adjusting for mental health history and smoking history and sociodemographic factors. Correlation analysis and structural equation modelling results were consistent in showing that both directions of the relationship were statistically significant.Conclusions The association between poor mental health and smoking in young women appeared to be bi-directional. © 2012 Cambridge University Press. ; Anxiety, Depression, Mental health, Psychological distress, Smoking ; adolescent, adult, aged, article, Australia, cross-sectional study, epidemiology, female, human, longitudinal study, mental disease, mental health, mental stress, middle aged, pregnancy, prevalence, psychological aspect, psychological rating scale, smoking, socioeconomics, statistical model, statistics, time, women's health, Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Australia, Causality, Cross-Sectional Studies, Female, Humans, Longitudinal Studies, Mental Disorders, Mental Health, Middle Aged, Models, Statistical, Pregnancy, Prevalence, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Smoking, Socioeconomic Factors, Stress, Psychological, Time Factors, Women's Health, Young Adult ; 22011372,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860738616

The qualities of these beams are described according to the International Electrotechical Commission 61267 standard and the Technical Report Series 457 International Atomic Energy Agency report. Specifically, the non-attenuated RQR-M beam series was studied. Methods: A Si-PIN diode-based spectrometer and the PENELOPE Monte Carlo code (v. 2008F1) were used for experiments and simulations, respectively. In addition, an ionization chamber was used to determine the half-value layers (HVLs) of each beam quality. The measurements were done in the mammography dosimeter calibration setup of our laboratory, and the Monte Carlo simulations reproduced such conditions. Results: The relative differences between the HVLs calculated from experimental and simulated spectra were lower than 2.4% for all the beam qualities studied. These differences are 1.2% and 3.1% when comparing the HVLs calculated from the experimental and simulated spectra to those determined by using the ionization chamber, respectively. A semi-empirical relation was found to obtain the nominal tube potential from the effective tube potential. Conclusion: According to our results, the mammography beams used in this work have energy spectra similar to clinical beams. © 2012 The British Institute of Radiology.,,article, diode, dosimetry, image quality, ionization chamber, mammography, Monte Carlo method, radiation beam, spectrometry, Humans, Mammography, Models, Statistical, Monte Carlo Method, Photons, Radiation Dosage, Spectrometry, X-Ray Emission, X-Rays ; 22010026,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860911025

Data: A total of 698 respondents from the Danish population and 969 GPs answered the questionnaire in May and September 2010. Methods: In a discrete choice experiment, GPs and patients made both forced and unforced choices, allowing us to explore the congruence of preferences 1) when patients must choose a new GP and 2) when they can stay with their current GP. Results: Results show that in the forced choice, preferences are seen to differ. In the unforced choice also, preferences differ - mainly because GPs overestimate their own importance to the patients. Rank orders, however, are similar for both GPs and patients. Conclusions: It is concluded that GPs do not have a precise knowledge of patients' preferences. However, in the unforced choice, GPs do know on which attributes to compete although they underestimate the necessity of competition. The overall conclusion is that there is room for improving the agency relationship in the organization of general practice. © 2012, International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR). ; discrete choice experiment, general practice, organization, principal-agent relationship ; adult, article, consultation, decision making, female, forced choice method, general practice, general practitioner, human, male, patient preference, priority journal, questionnaire, time, Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Choice Behavior, Denmark, Female, General Practice, General Practitioners, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Models, Statistical, Patient Preference, Physician-Patient Relations, Questionnaires, Young Adult ; 22583462,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84861177580

Evidence of the impact of olive oil consumption on BMI and the risk of obesity is limited. We analyzed this association taking into consideration the problem of energy underreporting. Methods: Cross-sectional data on 6,352 Spanish adults were analyzed. Dietary intake was assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire. Height and weight were measured. Results: Higher olive oil consumption was not associated with energy compensation in the overall diet. Olive oil consumptionwas positively associated (p < 0.004) with BMI in non-energy-adjusted multivariate linear regression models. Statistical significance of this association disappeared after controlling for energy intake in plausible energy intake reporters. The obesity risk increased for olive oil consumption of more than 2 tablespoons/day in both plausible energy intake reporters (odds ratio 1.30 (95% CI 1.01-1.70)) and energy intake underreporters (odds ratio 3.06 (95% CI 2.15-4.35)). This association was not significant after additional adjustment for energy intake (odds ratio 1.19 (95% CI 0.91-1.56)) in plausible energy intake reporters. Conclusion: Olive oilintake did not affect BMI and the risk of obesity after adjustment for total energy intake in plausible energy intake reporters. The lack of energy intake compensation for olive oil consumption might explain the positive associations in models not adjusted for energy. Copyright © 2012 S.

This paper reviews the current status of SDM in Israel, including efforts to promote SDM in the legislation and healthcare system, its influence in medical training and the national health plans, and funding for SDM-related research. Published studies of SDM in Israel are also reviewed. Although informed consent and patients' right to information are regulated by Israeli law, little provision is made for SDM. Further, there are few organized programs to promote SDM among medical professionals or the public, and governmental support of SDM-related research is minimal. Nonetheless, patients have begun to influence litigation in both formal and informal capacities, medical schools have begun to incorporate courses for improving physician-patient communication into their curricula, and the largest national health plan has initiated a plan to increase public awareness. A review of the limited research literature suggests that although patients and physicians express a desire for greater patient involvement, they often have reservations about its implementation. Research also suggests that despite the positive effects of SDM, such an approach may only infrequently be applied in actual clinical practice. In conclusion, though not actively promoting SDM at present, Israel's universal coverage and small number of health plans make rapid, widespread advances in SDM feasible. Israeli policymakers should thus be encouraged to nurture burgeoning initiatives and set plausible milestones. Comparing the status of SDM in Israel with that in other countries may stimulate further advancement. © 2012 Miron-Shatz et al, licensee BioMed Central Ltd. ; health care system, informed consent, Israel, patient autonomy, patient participation, Shared decision-making ; ambivalence, Article, awareness, clinical practice, decision making, genetic counseling, health care, health care personnel, health care planning, health care quality, health care system, health insurance, hospitalization, human, Israel, medical care, medical education, mental patient, patient advocacy, patient autonomy, patient satisfaction, primary medical care, professionalism, terminal care,,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84893641223

Despite important differences between these two types of dependence, one is easily mistaken for the other, and the possibility that both are at work is commonly ignored. We fit a series of hierarchical and spatially-explicit multilevel models to a U.S. county-level life dataset of life expectancy in 1999 to demonstrate approaches for data analysis and interpretation when multiple sources of area-clustering are present. We demonstrate the methods to detect, interpret, and differentiate evidence of spatial and geographic membership effects and discuss key considerations for analyzing data with spatial or/and membership dimensions. We find evidence that life expectancy is driven by both within-state geographic process, and by spatial processes. We argue that considering spatial and membership processes simultaneously yields valuable insights into the patterning of area variations in health. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. ; Geographic variability, Life expectancy, Multilevel modeling, Spatial analysis, States, U.S. counties ; data set, geographical variation, health status, life expectancy, modeling, spatial analysis, article, Bayes theorem, calculation, cluster analysis, data analysis, geographic distribution, health care access, health care availability, intermethod comparison, life expectancy, Monte Carlo method, premature mortality, priority journal, public health service, statistical model, United States, United States,,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84861931882

The DIF of alexithymia can be used as a screening index for adjustment disorder. With the high degree of association between alexithymia and other psychiatric disorders, especially in those relatively lacking in the ability to empathize, future studies should investigate whether DIF can be generalizable to the screening of other empathy-related and psychiatric disorders. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. ; Adjustment disorder, Alexithymia, Mental health, Personality characteristics, Screening index ; adjustment disorder, adult, alexithymia, article, child parent relation, controlled study, human, major clinical study, male, mental health, personality, predictor variable, screening test, Adjustment Disorders, Adult, Affective Symptoms, Humans, Male, Military Personnel, Models, Statistical, Parenting, Personality, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Risk Factors, ROC Curve, Sensitivity and Specificity ; 21046249,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955727301

He serves as gatekeeper and plays a key role in counselling and treatment guidance. Objectives: To calculate the approximate HCV caseload per practice and characterize PCPs management of the disease, in particular, to determine antiviral treatment rates and reasons for PCPs for withholding treatment. The ultimate objective was to identify potentially modifiable barriers to treatment. Methods: A confidential self-administered questionnaire centred on the above-mentioned questions was distributed to 2371 Swiss primary care physicians. All respondents of the main questionnaire received an additional small questionnaire focussed on the initial disease workup. Descriptive statistics were used to describe questionnaire responses and PCP demographics. Results: The response rate was 53.1%. Of all participating PCPs (n = 1084), 86.2% reported having patients with chronic HCV, with an average number of 4 patients per practice, 18.6% (n = 142) of PCPs did not monitor their chronic HCV patients. Two-thirds (66.8%) of the sample chronic HCV patient population (n = 4626) never received antiviral therapy. The main reasons given by PCPs for withholding treatment were HCV-specialist advice, patient preference, normal liver enzymes and patient related factors like substance abuse or psychiatric co morbidity. Conclusions: Most PCPs follow patients with chronic hepatitis C, but practice caseloads are low, which may account for insecurity in managing this complex disease. © 2011 Informa Healthcare. ; barriers to treatment, disease workup, Hepatitis C, patient monitoring, primary care physician ; antivirus agent, liver enzyme, article, comorbidity, demography, hepatitis C, human, medical specialist, patient counseling, primary medical care, questionnaire, substance abuse, Switzerland, Antiviral Agents, Female, Hepatitis C, Chronic, Humans, Male, Patient Preference, Physician's Practice Patterns, Primary Health Care, Questionnaires, Switzerland, Withholding Treatment ; 21517703,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79957514080

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether single concentration-time points could adequately predict moclobemide systemic exposure. Pharmacokinetic data (full 7-point pharmacokinetic profiles), obtained from 21 depressive inpatients receiving moclobemide (150 mg 3 times daily), were randomly split into development (n = 18) and validation (n = 16) sets. Correlations between the single concentration-time points and the area under the concentration-time curve within a 6-hour dosing interval at steady-state (AUC 0-6) were assessed by linear regression analyses. The predictive performance of single-point sampling strategies was evaluated in the validation set by mean prediction error, mean absolute error, and root mean square error. Plasma concentrations in the absorption phase yielded unsatisfactory predictions of moclobemide AUC 0-6. The best estimation of AUC 0-6 was achieved from concentrations at 4 and 6 hours following dosing. As the most reliable surrogate for moclobemide systemic exposure, concentrations at 4 and 6 hours should be used instead of predose trough concentrations as an indicator of between-patient variability and a guide for dose adjustments in specific clinical situations. © 2011 The Author(s). ; depressive patients, Moclobemide, predictive performance, single-point sampling strategies, systemic exposure ; alprazolam, amlodipine, atenolol, bromazepam, carbamazepine, cefalexin, diazepam, enalapril, famotidine, lorazepam, metoprolol, moclobemide, nifedipine, nitrazepam, propranolol, ranitidine, valproic acid, adult, area under the curve, article, blood sampling, clinical article, depression, drug efficacy, drug exposure, drug screening, female, human, limit of quantitation, male, measurement error, prediction, steady state, treatment response, validation therapy, Adult, Antidepressive Agents, Area Under Curve, Depression, Drug Administration Schedule, Drug Monitoring, Drug Therapy, Combination, Female, Humans, Inpatients, Linear Models, Male, Middle Aged, Moclobemide, Models, Biological, Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors, Predictive Value of Tests, Reproducibility of Results, Serbia ; 20495135,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955541937

The application of this joint model in aging research is relatively rare, albeit particularly useful, when there is the potential for nonrandom dropout. In this article we illustrate the method and discuss some issues that may arise when fitting joint models of this type. Using prose recall scores from the Swedish OCTO-Twin Longitudinal Study of Aging, we fitted a joint longitudinal-survival model to investigate the association between risk of mortality and individual differences in rates of change in memory. A model describing change in memory scores as following an accelerating decline trajectory and a Weibull survival model was identified as the best fitting. This model adjusted for random effects representing individual variation in initial memory performance and change in rate of decline as linking terms between the longitudinal and survival models. Memory performance and change in rate of memory decline were significant predictors of proximity to death. Joint longitudinal-survival models permit researchers to gain a better understanding of the association between change functions and risk of particular events, such as disease diagnosis or death. Careful consideration of computational issues may be required because of the complexities of joint modeling methodologies. © 2011 by Hogrefe Publishing. ; aging, cognitive decline, joint longitudinal survival models, memory scores ; aged, article, controlled study, death, dementia, female, human, longitudinal study, major clinical study, male, memory, memory disorder, mental performance, mortality, prediction, priority journal, recall, statistical model, survival, Sweden,,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84455193171

However, through the application of new technologies and the further development of risk-based approaches for safety assessment, we remain confident it is ultimately achievable. For many complex, multi-organ consumer safety endpoints, the development, evaluation and application of new, non-animal approaches is hampered by a lack of biological understanding of the underlying mechanistic processes involved. The enormity of this scientific challenge should not be underestimated. To tackle this challenge a substantial research programme was initiated by Unilever in 2004 to critically evaluate the feasibility of a new conceptual approach based upon the following key components: 1. Developing new, exposure-driven risk assessment approaches 2. Developing new biological (in vitro) and computer-based (in silico) predictive models 3. Evaluating the applicability of new technologies for generating data (e.g. omics, informatics) and for integrating new types of data (e.g. systems approaches) for risk-based safety assessment Our research efforts are focussed in the priority areas of skin allergy, cancer and general toxicity (including inhaled toxicity). In all of these areas, a long-term investment is essential to increase the scientific understanding of the underlying biology and molecular mechanisms that we believe will ultimately form a sound basis for novel risk assessment approaches. Our research programme in these priority areas consists of in-house research as well as Unilever-sponsored academic research, involvement in EU-funded projects (e.g. Sens-it-iv, Carcinogenomics), participation in cross-industry collaborative research (e.g. Colipa, EPAA) and ongoing involvement with other scientific initiatives on non-animal approaches to risk assessment (e.g. UK NC3Rs, US Human Toxicology Project consortium). ; Cancer, Colipa, EPAA, European Commission, NC3Rs, Risk assessment, Skin allergy ; antiinfective agent, silicon, article, biomics, clinical evaluation, computer aided design, drug mechanism, drug safety, drug screening, European Union, health program, human, in vitro study, information system, medical research, medical technology, molecular model, neoplasm, public-private partnership, risk assessment, skin allergy, toxicity, animal, animal testing alternative, biological model, computer simulation, methodology, organization and management, product safety, research, standard, Animal Testing Alternatives, Animals, Computer Simulation, Consumer Product Safety, Dermatitis, Allergic Contact, Humans, Models, Biological, Neoplasms, Research, Risk Assessment ; 21113564,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952635364

We examined two research questions: First, using a data-driven approach, exploratory factor analysis (EFA), will symptoms that define MDD and GAD appear together in one factor, or are they separable into the hypothesized dimensions of the disorders? Second, using a theory-driven approach, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), how will the structural integrity of the resulting factors compare with those of the various models that have been used to explain the relation between the symptoms? Material/Methods: Participants (n=3303) were a general population sample of adult Kuwaitis who self-completed the DSM-IV-TR criteria-based questionnaires for MDD and GAD. Exploratory factor analysis was by principal axis factoring, with oblique rotation. Models were compared in CFA using 7 fit indices in AMOS-16 software. Results: The questionnaires had adequate psychometrics. In the EFA, each questionnaire yielded 2 factors (somatic-affective and cognitive), but when the items were combined, 3 factors emerged (somatic-affective/general distress: depressed, core anxiety, and cognitive-depression). In CFA, only the (hierarchical) bifactor model and the (dimensional) model characterized by correlation of the 3 factors met the fit criteria. Conclusions: Our findings have widened the cross-cultural base of the evidence that while the symptoms of MDD and GAD form separate empiric clusters, there is an overlap of symptoms, which the disorders share. The relationship between the disorders' symptoms probably has hierarchical and dimensional elements. © Med Sci Monit. ; Arab, Comorbidity, Factor analysis, Generalized anxiety, Major depression ; adolescent, adult, aged, Arab, article, cognition, female, generalized anxiety disorder, human, major depression, male, psychometry, questionnaire, symptom, anxiety disorder, Arab, differential diagnosis, factorial analysis, Kuwait, major depression, methodology, psychological aspect, statistical model, Anxiety Disorders, Arabs, Depressive Disorder, Major, Diagnosis, Differential, Factor Analysis, Statistical, Humans, Kuwait, Models, Statistical, Psychometrics, Questionnaires ; 21119591,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79751472925

The misclassification induced by imperfect sensitivities and specificities of diagnostic tests must be accounted for when planning prevalence studies or investigations into properties of new tests. The previous work has shown that applying a single imperfect test to estimate prevalence can often result in very large sample size requirements, and that sometimes even an infinite sample size is insufficient for precise estimation because the problem is non-identifiable. Adding a second test can sometimes reduce the sample size substantially, but infinite sample sizes can still occur as the problem remains non-identifiable. We investigate the further improvement possible when three diagnostic tests are to be applied. We first develop methods required for studies when three conditionally independent tests are available, using different Bayesian criteria. We then apply these criteria to prototypic scenarios, showing that large sample size reductions can occur compared to when only one or two tests are used. As the problem is now identifiable, infinite sample sizes cannot occur except in pathological situations. Finally, we relax the conditional independence assumption, demonstrating in this once again non-identifiable situation that sample sizes may substantially grow and possibly be infinite. We apply our methods to the planning of two infectious disease studies, the first designed to estimate the prevalence of Strongyloides infection, and the second relating to estimating the sensitivity of a new test for tuberculosis transmission. The much smaller sample sizes that are typically required when three as compared to one or two tests are used should encourage researchers to plan their studies using more than two diagnostic tests whenever possible. User-friendly software is available for both design and analysis stages greatly facilitating the use of these methods. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ; Bayesian design, Diagnostic test, Latent class model, Misclassification, Sample size ; article, Bayes theorem, diagnostic accuracy, diagnostic test, disease transmission, gold standard, prevalence, sample size, sensitivity analysis, strongyloidiasis, tuberculosis, Animals, Bayes Theorem, Diagnostic Techniques and Procedures, Humans, Likelihood Functions, Models, Statistical, Research Design, Sample Size, Strongyloides, Strongyloidiasis, Tuberculosis ; 20803558,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77958564508

This occurs, for example, when inclusion probabilities for the subsample depend on first-stage results and/or on a covariate related to disease status. Reference standard bias arises when the reference test itself has imperfect sensitivity and specificity, but this information is ignored in the analysis. Reference standard bias typically results in underestimation of the sensitivity and specificity of the test under evaluation, since subjects that are correctly diagnosed by the test can be considered as misdiagnosed owing to the imperfections in the reference standard. In this paper, we describe a Bayesian approach for simultaneously addressing both verification and reference standard bias. Our models consider two types of verification bias, first when subjects are selected for verification based on initial test results alone, and then when selection is based on initial test results and a covariate. We also present a model that adjusts for a third potential bias that arises when tests are analyzed assuming conditional independence between tests, but some dependence exists between the initial test and the reference test. We examine the properties of our models using simulated data, and then apply them to a study of a screening test for dementia, providing bias-adjusted estimates of the sensitivity and specificity.

Methods: Assessment of 739 colorectal lesions ?6 mm detected prospectively at CTC screening in 479 patients was performed. By-polyp PPV was analyzed according to small (6-9 mm) versus large (?10 mm) size, morphology (sessile/pedunculated/ flat), diagnostic confidence level (3 ? most confident, 1 ? least confident), and histology. By-patient PPV was analyzed at various polyp size thresholds. Results: By-polyp PPV for CTC-detected lesions ?6 mm, 6-9 mm, and ?10 mm was 91.6% (677/739), 90.1% (410/451), and 92.7% (267/288), respectively (p=0.4). By-polyp PPV according to sessile, pedunculated, flat, and masslike morphology was 92.5% (441/477), 96.5% (139/144), 77.7% (73/94), and 97.6% (40/41), respectively (p<0.0001 for flat versus polypoid morphology). By-polyp PPV according to diagnostic confidence level was 94.7% (554/585) for highest (= level 3), 83.5% (106/127) for intermediate (= level 2), and 63.0% (17/27) for lowest (= level 1) confidence (p<0.0001 for levels-2/3 versus level-1). By-patient PPV at 6-mm, 8-mm, 10-mm, and 30-mm polyp size thresholds was 92.3% (442/479), 93.0% (306/329), 93.1% (228/245), and 97.4% (38/39), respectively. Conclusion: The overall per-polyp and per-patient PPV for lesions ?6 mm was 92% for CTC screening. Increased diagnostic confidence and polypoid (non-flat) morphology correlated with a higher PPV, whereas small versus large polyp size had very little effect. © European Society of Radiology 2009. ; Colorectal cancer screening, CT colonography, Polyps, Virtual colonoscopy ; adult, article, colorectal tumor, computed tomographic colonography, diagnostic value, female, histology, human, major clinical study, male, morphology, polyp, predictive validity, priority journal, tumor diagnosis, tumor differentiation, tumor volume, colon polyp, middle aged, pathology, predictive value, procedures, radiography, sensitivity and specificity, Colonic Polyps, Colonography, Computed Tomographic, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Predictive Value of Tests, Sensitivity and Specificity, Colonic Polyps, Colonography, Computed Tomographic, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Predictive Value of Tests, Sensitivity and Specificity ; 20069423,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952576239

Materials and Methods: A total of 376 men with a median age of 65.5 years (range 45.8 to 79.5) with low risk prostate cancer on surveillance underwent at least 1 followup biopsy after diagnosis. Progression was defined at surveillance biopsy as Gleason pattern 4 or 5, greater than 2 biopsy cores with cancer or greater than 50% involvement of any core with cancer. Proportional hazards analysis was used to evaluate the association between covariates and progression at surveillance biopsy. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the probability of disease progression. Results: Of the 376 men 123 (32.7%) had progression a median of 5.6 years (range 0.3 to 8.5) after diagnosis. Percent free PSA and maximum percent core involvement at diagnosis were associated with progression, allowing stratification of the progression risk at initial surveillance biopsy. Cancer presence and PSA density at initial surveillance biopsy were associated with subsequent progression, allowing stratification of the cumulative incidence of progression 3 years after initial surveillance biopsy (cumulative incidence 11.1%, 95% CI 4.7 to 25.2 for negative biopsy and PSAD less than 0.08 ng/ml/cm3 vs 53.6%, 95% CI 38.6 to 70.0 for positive biopsy and PSAD 0.08 ng/ml/cm3 or greater, log rank test p &lt,0.0001). Conclusions: Clinical variables at diagnosis and at first surveillance biopsy during followup in an active surveillance program can be used to inform men about the likelihood of an unfavorable prostate biopsy. This information could improve patient and physician acceptance of active surveillance in carefully selected men. © 2010 American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc. ; biopsy, disease progression, prostate, prostate specific antigen, prostatic neoplasms ; prostate specific antigen, adult, aged, article, cancer growth, cancer incidence, cancer risk, controlled study, disease surveillance, follow up, Gleason score, human, human tissue, major clinical study, male, priority journal, prostate biopsy, prostate cancer, risk assessment, Aged, Biopsy, Disease Progression, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Population Surveillance, Proportional Hazards Models, Prostatic Neoplasms, Risk Assessment ; 20304433,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77950518017

Cost-effectiveness analyses may better reflect the full costs and benefits of medical interventions if they incorporate the effects of patients health on their family members. Objective. To develop and apply a time tradeoff (TTO) technique to measure the impact of potential prostate cancer-related health states of the patients on the quality of life (QOL) of their partners. Methods. We developed modified TTO questions and applied them in a pilot study in which we asked the partner of the patient to tradeoff his or her own life in order to reduce the burden that he himself or she herself expects to experience if the patient developed one of the prostate cancer-related health states. We reviewed the theoretical justification for this question and carefully framed the question so as to reduce measurement error and also to avoid possible double counting with the effect on the partners health. Results. We collected data from 26 partners about their preferences for their own health, which is influenced by the patients health condition. The mean QOL weights for the partners when the patients are the following states are healthy, 0.81, impotent, 0.66, incontinent, 0.68, have metastatic disease, 0.50, and dead, 0.28. Partners responses varied by how close they felt to the patients. Low correlations between partners and patients QOL ratings (n = 15) suggest that the partners were not responding as proxies for the patient. Conclusions. A new TTO method is proposed to measure a partners QOL due to a patients health. Preliminary test results of validity were promising. ; Cost-effectiveness analysis., Prostate cancer, Spillover effects, Time trade-off, Utilities ; aged, article, caregiver, cost benefit analysis, cost of illness, economics, female, human, male, middle aged, nursing, prostate tumor, psychological aspect, quality of life, questionnaire, sexuality, Sickness Impact Profile, statistical model, time, Aged, Caregivers, Cost of Illness, Cost-Benefit Analysis, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Models, Statistical, Prostatic Neoplasms, Quality of Life, Questionnaires, Sexual Partners, Sickness Impact Profile, Time Factors ; 20228288,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952977059

The main aim is to examine whether initiation of toilet training after 24 months is associated with increased odds of daytime wetting in school-age children. Method: The study is based on more than 8000 children, aged 4.5 to 9 years, from a UK birth cohort-The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Using multinomial logistic regression, the analysis examined the association between age at initiation of toilet training and 4 previously established trajectory groups representing different patterns of development of daytime bladder control (described as normative development, delayed acquisition, persistent daytime wetting, and relapse). Results: Compared with children whose toilet training was initiated between 15 and 24 months, initiation of toilet training after 24 months was associated with higher odds of membership to the trajectory groups representing persistent daytime wetting (1.52 [1.23-1.88], p < .001), delayed acquisition of daytime bladder control (1.47 [1.29-1.66], p < .001), or relapse in daytime wetting (1.52 [1.28-1.80], p < .001). Adjustment for confounding variables, including sex, developmental delay, difficult temperament, and the motheraàôs self-reported depression, did not alter the main conclusions. Conclusion: There is evidence that initiating toilet training after 24 months is associated with problems attaining and maintaining bladder control. It is possible that delaying the onset of toilet training until after 2 years prolongs the exposure time to potential stressors that could interfere with the acquisition of bladder control, resulting in delays in achieving continence and susceptibility to relapses in daytime wetting.

The three-state model can be used to estimate life expectancies in health and ill health. In this article, continuous-time Markov models are specified for the transitions between the three states. Transition intensities are regressed on age as a time-dependent covariate. The covariate is handled in a piecewise-constant fashion where the time interval between two consecutive observations is divided into subintervals of fixed and equal lengths. Study design choices such as sample size, length of follow-up, and time intervals between observations are investigated in a simulation study. The effects on parameter estimation are discussed as well as the effects on the estimation of life expectancies. In addition, data taken from the UK Cognitive Functioning and Ageing Study are analysed. © 2009 SAGE Publications.,,aged, aging, article, calculation, case study, cognitive defect, controlled study, experimental design, female, hidden Markov model, human, intermethod comparison, interview, life expectancy, longitudinal study, major clinical study, male, mini mental state examination, probability, scoring system, simulation, United Kingdom, wellbeing, Aged, Aging, Biometry, Cognition, Female, Great Britain, Humans, Life Expectancy, Longitudinal Studies, Male, Markov Chains, Models, Statistical ; 18445698,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-68349107927

This study aims at testing the feasibility and validity of the real computer-adaptive application. The D-CAT, supplied by a bank of 64 items, was administered on personal digital assistants (PDAs) to 423 consecutive patients suffering from psychosomatic and other medical conditions (78 with depression). Items were adaptively administered until a predetermined reliability (r ? 0.90) was attained. For validation purposes, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) scale, and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were administered. Another sample of 114 patients was evaluated using standardized diagnostic interviews [Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI)]. The D-CAT was quickly completed (mean 74 seconds), well accepted by the patients and reliable after an average administration of only six items. In 95% of the cases, 10 items or less were needed for a reliable score estimate. Correlations between the D-CAT and the HADS, CES-D, and BDI ranged between r = 0.68 and r = 0.77. The D-CAT distinguished between diagnostic groups as well as established questionnaires do. The D-CAT proved an effi cient, well accepted and reliable tool. Discriminative power was comparable to other depression measures, whereby the CAT is shorter and more precise. Item usage raises questions of balancing the item selection for content in the future.

Study Design and Setting: The model was externally validated in 414 Canadian animal health apprentices. Several approaches were used: (1) no adjustment, (2) recalibration of the intercept of the model, (3) re-estimation of the intercept and the regression coefficients of predictors, and (4) model revision, by excluding the existing predictor(s) and/or including new predictor(s). The bootstrapping procedure was done following the third and fourth methods. The calibration was assessed graphically and with the Hosmer-Lemeshow (HL) test. Discriminative properties were determined by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC area). Results: When applied without adjustment, the model's discriminative ability was adequate (ROC area was 0.74 vs. the original ROC area of 0.76), the calibration was poor (HL test P < 0.001). The other methods yielded models with good calibration (P > 0.10) and reasonable discrimination (ROC area ranged between 0.73 and 0.75). The refitted and revised model showed a good internal validity (correction factor from the bootstrapping procedure was more than 0.90). Conclusion: Once updated, the diagnostic model is valid and can be applied with reasonable performance in an animal health apprentice setting. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Very few studies analyze the scale from the standpoint of item response theory. This article sought to analyze how the HADS fits the Rasch model in PD. The HADS was administered to 387 PD patients. Three sets of Rasch analyses were performed for the HADS total score, and anxiety and depression subscales (HADS-T, -A, and -D, respectively). Although the HADS-T and HADS-A displayed a good fit, with little threshold disordering and no differential item functioning, the HADS-D failed to fit the model. The person separation index, a reliability measure, was 0.87 (HADS-T) and 0.80 (HADS-A). Both HADS-T and HADS-A showed unidimensionality. Our results supported the use of HADS-T as a measure of psychological distress in PD patients. Moreover, the HADS-A was also an adequate anxiety measure. Further research is required to address the use of HADS-D in PD. © 2008 Movement Disorder Society. ; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Parkinson's disease, Rasch analysis ; age distribution, anxiety disorder, article, construct validity, depression, educational status, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, human, major clinical study, mental stress, Parkinson disease, priority journal, Rasch analysis, reliability, scoring system, adult, affect, aged, anxiety, depression, female, male, middle aged, Parkinson disease, personality test, physiology, psychological rating scale, sensitivity and specificity, statistical model, Adult, Affect, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Anxiety, Depression, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Models, Statistical, Parkinson Disease, Personality Inventory, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Sensitivity and Specificity ; 19097178,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67651149795

This article discusses model-based statistical methods for the classification of units into one of two or more groups where, for each unit, repeated measurements over time are obtained on each outcome. We relate the observed outcomes using multivariate nonlinear mixed-effects models to describe evolutions in different groups. Due to its flexibility, the random-effects approach for the joint modeling of multiple outcomes can be used to estimate population parameters for a discriminant model that classifies units into distinct predefined groups or populations. Parameter estimation is done via the expectation-maximization algorithm with a linear approximation step. We conduct a simulation study that sheds light on the effect that the linear approximation has on classification results. We present an example using data from a study in 161 pregnant women in Santiago, Chile, where the main interest is to predict normal versus abnormal pregnancy outcomes. © 2008, The International Biometric Society. ; Discriminant analysis, Joint modeling, Missing data, Multivariate responses, Nonlinear mixed-effects models ; discriminant analysis, numerical model, optimization, pregnancy, simulation, algorithm, analytical research, article, classification, data analysis, discriminant analysis, female, human, longitudinal study, multivariate analysis, outcome assessment, parameter, pregnancy outcome, pregnant woman, simulation, statistical model, Biometry, Chile, Discriminant Analysis, Female, Humans, Longitudinal Studies, Pregnancy, Pregnancy Outcome ; 18363774,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-62749090547

Their role in early bronchial carcinogenesis was analysed in 60 biopsies obtained by fluorescence bronchoscopy (six per stage: normal tissue of nonsmokers, normal normofluor- escent and hypofluorescent bronchial tissue of smokers, hyperplasia, metaplasia, mild, moderate and severe dysplasia, in situ carcinoma and invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SQCC)). In total, 69 microRNAs were found to be differentially expressed in the course of bronchial carcinogenesis. Among them, some microRNAs showed a linear evolution of their expression level, such as miR-32 and miR-34c, whose expression progressively decreased from normal bronchial tissues of nonsmokers to SQCC. Others behaved differently at successive stages, such as miR-142-3p or miR-9, or are only altered from a specific stage, such as miR-199a or miR-139. MicroRNAs globally followed a two-step evolution, first decreasing (a reverse of their increase during embryogenesis) during the earliest morphological modifications of bronchial epithelium, and thereafter increasing at later stages of lung carcinogenesis. Moreover, microRNA expression was very efficient for the prediction of the histological classification between low- and high-grade lesions and between in situ and invasive carcinoma. The present data show, for the first time, that microRNAs are involved in bronchial carcinogenesis from the very early steps of this process and, thus, could provide tools for early detection of lung cancer.

Some scientists are interested in studying this effect to get early detection of breast cancer. Since experimental methods for optimization are time consuming and expensive, some scientists suggest using simulation. Monte Carlo (MC) codes are the best option for radiation simulation, however, one permanent defect with MC codes has been the lack of a sufficient physical model for coherent (Rayleigh) scattering, including molecular interference effects. Materials and Methods: It was decided to obtain molecular interference functions of coherent X-ray scattering for normal breast tissues by combination of modeling and experimental methods. A Monte Carlo simulation program was written to simulate the angular distribution of scattered photons for the normal breast tissue samples. Moreover, experimental diffraction patterns of these tissues were measured by means of energy dispersive X-ray diffraction (EDXRD) method. The simulation and experimental data were used to obtain a tabulation of molecular interference functions for breast tissues. Results: With this study a tabulation of molecular interference functions for normal breast tissues was prepared to facilitate the simulation diffraction patterns of the tissues without any experimental. Conclusion: The method may lead to design new systems for early detection of breast cancer. Iran. J. Radiat.

Face-to-face interviews were conducted with 723 Missouri youth (Mage = 15.5, SD = 1.2) in residential care for antisocial behavior. The lifetime prevalence of nitrite inhalant use was 1.7% (1.3% for boys, 4.3% for girls, p =.06), a figure somewhat higher than comparable estimates from the MTF and NSDUH national surveys. Most lifetime users reported nitrite use in the prior year (92%) and experienced intoxication (83%) during periods of nitrite inhalation. Nitrite users had significantly higher scores on measures of somatization, obsessive-compulsive traits, interpersonal sensitivity, impulsivity, fearlessness, suicidality, and polydrug use and were significantly more likely to have suffered a serious head injury and to be White than their non-nitrite-using counterparts. Nitrite users also reported significantly higher levels of current psychiatric distress related to periods of faintness or dizziness, hot or cold spells, difficulty making decisions, and their ìmind going blankî than did non-nitrite users. Antisocial adolescent nitrite users are at substantially elevated risk for serious functional impairments given their high rates of lifetime head injury, comparatively more varied and intensive levels of involvement with psychoactive drugs, and symptom reports suggestive of psychiatric and cognitive dysfunction. © 2009 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC. ; Adolescents, Amyl nitrite, Antisocial, Butyl nitrite, Delinquents, Poppers ; nitrite, adolescent, adult, antisocial behavior, article, Caucasian, child, child behavior, cognitive defect, controlled study, decision making, distress syndrome, dizziness, drug abuse pattern, faintness, female, functional disease, head injury, human, impulsiveness, inhalant abuse, interview, intoxication, major clinical study, male, mental disease, multiple drug abuse, obsessive compulsive disorder, prevalence, race difference, residential care, risk assessment, risk factor, school child, scoring system, sex difference, social adaptation, somatization, suicidal behavior, United States ; 19705675,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-68449087205

Objective: To find out how important is the role of screening and clinical tumor characteristics in addition to cancer registry information in describing the breast cancer survival. Methods: A representative clinical database on 483 breast cancer patients diagnosed during 1996-1997 in Tampere University Hospital Area was linked with Finnish Cancer Registry data and a survival model including the available registry variables was compared to models including screen-detection information and clinical tumor characteristics also. Results and conclusion: Estimates of registry stage and age act as surrogates for clinical variables and mammography-detection. The surrogacy was found to be almost complete indicating that clinical variables are not necessarily needed when making breast cancer mortality predictions based on a population-based cancer registry.

The significance of isolated HGPIN in initial biopsy cores as a marker of PCa in repeat biopsies has been extensively investigated, but little is known of the true occurrence of PCa in this setting, because repeat biopsies can miss the focus of cancer. In this study, a hemi-prostate model was used to define the true positive predictive value of HGPIN in core biopsies in predicting PCa. Methods: From 132 consecutive resected prostate specimens, 70 hemi-prostates with all corresponding biopsy cores negative for PCa were thoroughly examined. Results: Of the 70 hemi-prostates, 38 had PCa (including 8 with clinically significant PCa), and 11 had HGPIN. In the group of 38 hemi-prostate with PCa, 7 were associated with HGPIN-positive biopsies. No statistically significant difference was found between the hemi-prostates with or without PCa, regarding the presence, microscopic pattern, or multiple core involvement of HGPIN in the biopsies. The positive predictive value of HGPIN in predicting for clinically significant PCa was 27%, the negative predictive value was 87%, the sensitivity was 38%, and the specificity was 91% (P = 0.04, statistically significant). In addition, the positive predictive value of multiple cores with HGPIN in predicting for clinically significant PCa was 75% (negative predictive value 92%). Conclusions: The results of the present study have failed to support HGPIN as a statistically significant predictor for the occurrence of PCa. More importantly, however, HGPIN and multiple core involvement did seem to be a useful marker for clinically significant PCa. © 2008.,,adult, article, cancer grading, controlled study, disease association, human, human tissue, immunohistochemistry, needle biopsy, priority journal, prognosis, prostate adenocarcinoma, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, sensitivity and specificity, Adenocarcinoma, Aged, Biopsy, Biopsy, Needle, Disease Progression, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Models, Statistical, Predictive Value of Tests, Prostate, Prostatectomy, Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia, Prostatic Neoplasms, Sensitivity and Specificity ; 18279923,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-50249117625

Human papillomavirus (HPV) plays a central role in the etiology of cervical cancer. It is important to describe the prevalence of HPV infection in different types of cervical lesions and to explore the relation between HPV viral load and the severity of cervical lesions. Methods: To describe the HPV infection prevalence and viral load in different age groups, we retrospectively investigated 6405 cases of women who were organized by their units to take health-examination. They were given Hybrid Capture II tests between January 2005 and December 2006. The correlation between HPV viral load and pathology was assessed. Results: Overall HPV infection prevalence was 29.1% (1864/6405), while in women 18-20 years old it was 54.4% (31/57), the highest among all age groups. After declining rapidly, HPV prevalence stabilized at about 30.0% in women aged 30 and older. Of the 6405 women, 1483 women had a colposcopic biopsy and 33.2% (492/1483) were positive for HPV DNA. Twenty-one percent of women with a normal diagnosis (238/1095) had HPV infection, a statistically significantly lower prevalence than in women with cervical lesions, including those with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (68.8% in CIN1, 66.7% in CIN2, and 76.5% in CIN3) or with cervical cancer (94.1%). The correlation coefficient between viral load and cervical lesion severity was 0.134, which was not statistically significant (P=0.075). Viral load values in women with CINs and cervical cancer were calculated, and no significant differences were identified.

Most current measures of the performance of a test, especially the indices of reliability, only tackle the variation of cases, and hence are not suitable for generalizing results across the population of readers. We attempted to study the effect of readers' variation on two measures of multireader reliability: pair-wise agreement and Fleiss' kappa. Study Design and Setting: We used a normal hierarchical model with a latent trait (signal) variable to simulate a binary decision-making task by different number of readers on an infinite sample of cases. Results: It could be shown that both measures, especially Fleiss' kappa, have a large sample variance when estimated by a small number of readers, casting doubt on their accuracy given the number of readers typically used in current reliability studies. Conclusion: The majority of the current agreement studies is likely limited by the number of readers and is unlikely to produce a reliable estimate of reader agreement. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Few longitudinal medical Spanish programs have been described and evaluated. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe development and evaluation of the preclinical phase of a 4-y program designed to graduate physicians who can provide language-concordant care in Spanish. SETTING: Study was done in one public medical school in southeastern USA. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: The program targeted intermediate/ advanced Spanish speakers. Standardized fluency assessments were used to determine eligibility and evaluate participants' progress. Curriculum included didactic coursework, simulated patients, socio-cultural seminars, clinical skills rotations at sites serving Latinos, service-learning, and international immersion. PROGRAM EVALUATION: For the first two cohorts (n=45) qualitative evaluation identified program improvement opportunities and found participants believed the program helped them maintain their Spanish skills. Mean interim (2-y) speaking proficiency scores were unchanged from baseline: 9.0 versus 8.7 at baseline on 12-point scale (p=0.15). Mean interim listening comprehension scores (second cohort only, n=25) increased from a baseline of 77 to 86% (p=0.003). Proportions passing the listening comprehension test increased from 72 to 92% (p=0.06). DISCUSSION: We describe development of a longitudinal Spanish program within a medical school. Participation was associated with improved Spanish listening comprehension and no change in speaking proficiency. © 2008 Society of General Internal Medicine. ; Communication, Education, Hispanic Americans, Language barriers, Latino, Medical ; article, cohort analysis, comprehension, cultural factor, curriculum, education program, health service, longitudinal study, medical education, medical school, scoring system, simulation, skill, Spain, speech, United States, Communication, Communication Barriers, Education, Medical, Undergraduate, Hispanic Americans, Humans, Language, Physician-Patient Relations, United States ; 18612739,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-46949104577

They use the model to conceptualize the various levels of influence expected from socioecological variables in individuals' mammography use decisions, build contextual variables from fine-grained data into four different types of geographic areas, and then use two- and three-level modeling of personal and area-level contextual factors to explain observed behavior. The central focus is on whether differentiating the conceptualized levels of influence seems to materially affect regression findings. The test could conceivably be confounded by the modifiable areal unit problem, but little evidence for this is found. Findings for California women suggest that distinctions do matter in how the levels of influence are defined for local neighborhood contextual factors. Studies using only county-level contextual factors will miss some meaningful associations related to interpersonal/ proximate-level factors. © 2008 Sage Publications. ; Access to care, Breast cancer screening, Mammography use, Modifiable areal unit problem, Multilevel model, Socioecological model ; aged, article, breast cancer, cancer screening, decision making, ecology, female, geography, health behavior, health care access, health care utilization, human, major clinical study, mammography, model, regression analysis, social aspect, United States, Aged, California, Confounding Factors (Epidemiology), Female, Humans, Mammography, Mass Screening, Middle Aged, Models, Statistical, Patient Acceptance of Health Care, Regression Analysis, SEER Program, Socioeconomic Factors ; 18259047,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-43449103374

The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is one of the common measures for the overall diagnostic accuracy. However, it may not differentiate the various shapes of the ROC curves with different diagnostic significances. The partial area under the ROC curve (PAUROC) may present an alternative that can provide additional and complimentary information for some diagnostic tests which require false-positive rate that does not exceed a certain level. Non-parametric and maximum likelihood methods can be used for the non-inferiority tests based on the difference in paired PAUROCs. However, their performance has not been investigated in finite samples. We propose to use the concept of generalized p-value to construct a non-inferiority test for diagnostic accuracy based on the difference in paired PAUROCs. Simulation results show that the proposed non-inferiority test not only adequately controls the size at the nominal level but also is uniformly more powerful than the non-parametric methods. The proposed method is illustrated with a numerical example using published data.

Concomitant advances in scalable computational algorithms are necessary to better utilize the information that is contained in these high-complexity experiments. The development of such tools has the potential to expand the utility of flow cytometric analysis from a predominantly hypothesis-driven mode to one of discovery, or hypothesis-generating research. A new method of analysis of flow cytometric data called Cytometric Fingerprinting (CF) has been developed. CF captures the set of multivariate probability distribution functions corresponding to list-mode data and then flattens them into a computationally efficient fingerprint representation that facilitates quantitative comparisons of samples. An experimental and synthetic data were generated to act as reference sets for evaluating CF. Without the introduction of prior knowledge, CF was able to discover the location and concentration of spiked cells in ungated analyses over a concentration range covering four orders of magnitude, to a lower limit on the order of 10 spiked events in a background of 100,000 events. We describe a new method for quantitative analysis of list-mode cytometric data. CF includes a novel algorithm for space subdivision that improves estimation of the probability density function by dividing space into nonrectangular polytopes. Additionally it renders a multidimensional distribution in the form of a one-dimensional multiresolution hierarchical fingerprint that creates a computationally efficient representation of high dimensionality distribution functions. CF supports both the generation and testing of hypotheses, eliminates sources of operator bias, and provides an increased level of automation of data analysis. © 2008 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry. ; Bioinformatics, Computational biology, Cytomics, Empirical modeling, Flow cytometry, Machine learning ; algorithm, article, automation, bioinformatics, concentration (parameters), controlled study, cytometric fingerprinting, cytometry, flow cytometry, high throughput screening, human, human cell, hypothesis, instrumentation, machine learning, priority journal, quantitative analysis, technology, Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence, Computational Biology, Data Interpretation, Statistical, Flow Cytometry, Humans, Leukocytes, Mononuclear, Models, Statistical, Multivariate Analysis, Quality Control ; 18383310,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-42949149596

Average life expectancy has steadily increased in the United States but there is limited information on long-term mortality trends in the US counties This study aimed to investigate trends in county mortality and cross-county mortality disparities, including the contributions of specific diseases to county level mortality trends. Methods and Findings: We used mortality statistics (from the National Center for Health Statistics [NCHS]) and population (from the US Census) to estimate sex-specific life expectancy for US counties for every year between 1961 and 1999. Data for analyses in subsequent years were not provided to us by the NCHS. We calculated different metrics of cross-county mortality disparity, and also grouped counties on the basis of whether their mortality changed favorably or unfavorably relative to the national average. We estimated the probability of death from specific diseases for counties with above- or below-average mortality performance. We simulated the effect of cross-county migration on each county's life expectancy using a time-based simulation model. Between 1961 and 1999, the standard deviation (SD) of life expectancy across US counties was at its lowest in 1983, at 1.9 and 1.4 y for men and women, respectively. Cross-county life expectancy SD increased to 2.3 and 1.7 y in 1999. Between 1961 and 1983 no counties had a statistically significant increase in mortality, the major cause of mortality decline for both sexes was reduction in cardiovascular mortality. From 1983 to 1999, life expectancy declined significantly in 11 counties for men (by 1.3 y) and in 180 counties for women (by 1.3 y), another 48 (men) and 783 (women) counties had nonsignificant life expectancy decline. Life expectancy decline in both sexes was caused by increased mortality from lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, and a range of other noncommunicable diseases, which were no longer compensated for by the decline in cardiovascular mortality. Higher HIV/AIDS and homicide deaths also contributed substantially to life expectancy decline for men, but not for women. Alternative specifications of the effects of migration showed that the rise in cross-county life expectancy SD was unlikely to be caused by migration. Conclusions: There was a steady increase in mortality inequality across the US counties between 1983 and 1999, resulting from stagnation or increase in mortality among the worst-off segment of the population. Female mortality increased in a large number of counties, primarily because of chronic diseases related to smoking, overweight and obesity, and high blood pressure. © 2008 Ezzati et al.,,acquired immune deficiency syndrome, adolescent, adult, aged, article, cardiovascular disease, cause of death, child, chronic obstructive lung disease, data analysis, death, diabetes mellitus, female, health care organization, homicide, human, Human immunodeficiency virus infection, hypertension, infant, life expectancy, lung cancer, major clinical study, male, metric system, migration, mortality, obesity, population research, probability, simulation, smoking, statistical analysis, statistical significance, United States, demography, geography, life expectancy, middle aged, newborn, preschool child, risk factor, socioeconomics, United States, Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Censuses, Child, Child, Preschool, Demography, Female, Geography, Humans, Infant, Infant, Newborn, Life Expectancy, Male, Middle Aged, Mortality, Risk Factors, Socioeconomic Factors, United States ; 18433290,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-43249087616

As inflammatory cytokines are involved in DSP, we addressed a role for inflammation in NRTI-SN by determining the alleles of immune-related genes carried by patients with and without NRTI-SN. Demographic details associated with risk of various neuropathies were included in the analysis. Alleles of 14 polymorphisms in 10 genes were determined in Australian HIV patients with definite NRTI-SN (symptom onset &lt,6 months after first dNRTI exposure, n = 16), NRTI-SN-resistant patients (no neuropathy despite &gt,6 months on dNRTIs, n = 20), patients with late onset NRTI-SN (neuropathy onset after &gt,6 months of dNRTIs, n = 19), and HIV-negative controls. Carriage of TNFA-1031*2 was highest in NRTI-SN patients, suggesting potentiation of NRTI-SN. Carriage of IL12B (3? UTR)*2 was higher in NRTI-SN-resistant patients than controls or NRTI-SN patients, suggesting a protective role. BAT1 (intron 10)*2 was more common in NRTI-SN than resistant patients, but neither group differed from controls. This marks the conserved HLA-A1, B8, DR3 haplotype. Of the demographic details considered, increasing height was associated with NRTI-SN risk. A model including cytokine genotype and height predicted NRTI-SN status (p &lt, 0.0001, R2 = 0.54). Late onset NRTI-SN patients clustered genetically with NRTI-SN-resistant patients, so these patients may be genetically protected. In addition to patient height, cytokine genotype influenced NRTI-SN risk following dNRTI exposure, suggesting inflammation contributes to NRTI-SN. © 2008 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.,,ABC transporter, HLA A1 antigen, HLA B8 antigen, HLA DR3 antigen, interleukin 12p40, protein bat1, RNA directed DNA polymerase inhibitor, tumor necrosis factor alpha, unclassified drug, 3' untranslated region, adult, aged, article, body height, controlled study, disease association, DNA polymorphism, gene frequency, genetic susceptibility, genotype, human, Human immunodeficiency virus infection, neurogenic inflammation, priority journal, risk factor, sensory neuropathy, Adult, Anti-HIV Agents, Australia, Body Height, Cytokines, Gene Frequency, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Haplotypes, HIV Infections, Humans, Middle Aged, Models, Statistical, Neuritis, Polymorphism, Genetic, Somatosensory Disorders ; 18240960,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-39549113449

The standard strains of S. mutans (ATCC 25175) and S. sanguis (ATCC 10556) were cultured on blood agar and incubated for 48 hr in three main environments: atmospheric air, carbon dioxide, and cigarette smoke. Kent gold 1Æ(nicotine: 0.1 mg, tar: 1 mg), Kent lightsÆ (nicotine: 0.8 mg, tar: 9 mg) and BahmanÆ (nicotine: 1 mg, tar: 13 mg) were the brands used in the present study. Afterwards, digital photographs of the colonies were taken and the diameter of colonies was measured. Data were analyzed using Post Hoc and General Linear Model statistical tests. Cigarette smoke and carbon dioxide environments significantly increased the growth of S. mutans. However, high nicotine/tar content cigarette smoke (BahmanÆ) had the greatest impact on S. mutans and S. sanguis. The mutans/sanguis ratio, which was 0.71 in atmospheric air, increased to 1.07 in the presence of carbon dioxide. Kent gold 1, Kent lights, and Bahman demonstrated a mutans/sanguis ratio of 1, 0.84, and 0.98 respectively.

To use mass spectrometry (MS) of serum proteins for early detection, a seamless workflow is needed that provides an opportunity for rapid profiling along with direct identification of the underpinning ions. Methods: We used carrier protein-bound affinity enrichment of serum samples directly coupled with MALDI orthagonal TOF MS profiling to rapidly search for potential ion signatures that contained discriminatory power. These ions were subsequently directly subjected to tandem MS for sequence identification. Results: We discovered several biomarker panels that enabled differentiation of stage I ovarian cancer from unaffected (age-matched) patients with no evidence of ovarian cancer, with positive results in >93% of samples from patients with disease-negative results and in 97% of disease-free controls. The carrier protein-based approach identified additional protein fragments, many from low-abundance proteins or proteins not previously seen in serum. Conclusions: This workflow system using a highly reproducible, high-resolution MALDI-TOF platform enables rapid enrichment and profiling of large numbers of clinical samples for discovery of ion signatures and integration of direct sequencing and identification of the ions without need for additional offline, time-consuming purification strategies. © 2007 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.,,biological marker, carrier protein, ion, peptide, peptide fragment, plasma protein, adult, algorithm, article, bioassay, cancer survival, controlled study, early diagnosis, female, high throughput screening, human, major clinical study, matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry, nucleotide sequence, ovary cancer, protein analysis, protein binding, reproducibility, sequence analysis, serum, tandem mass spectrometry, Blood Proteins, Carrier Proteins, Female, Humans, Ovarian Neoplasms, Peptides, Protein Binding, Proteomics, Sensitivity and Specificity, Serum, Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization, Tandem Mass Spectrometry, Tumor Markers, Biological ; 17463175,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34249864811

Methods: A tissue microarray with 168 points including normal adult brain tissue, diffuse astrocytoma (WHO grade II), anaplastic astrocytoma (WHO grade III), glioblastoma (WHO grade IV) and positive control tissues was employed. Double-labelling technique of immunohistochemistry staining was applied to mark endothelial cell and vascular endothelial growth foctor (VEGF). Image-Pro Plus (5.1 Chinese version) was used to measure the staining results and the indexes of VEGF positive unit (PU), micro-blood vessel (MBV) density, mean MBV perimeter. Screened the parameters related to the grade of astrocytoma by single factor analysis. On basis of these parameters from different tissue sections, we used FCM clustering method from the mathematical software in MATLAB to get the value of the FCM cluster and to compare it with the pathological grades of astrocytoma. Results: 1) The differences of VEGF PU value in different grade groups of astrocytoma were significant (P = 0.000), and the difference between each pathological grade group was also significant (P<0.05, for all). 2) The differences of MBV density in astrocytoma in different pathological grade groups were significant (P = 0.000), and the difference between each grade group was also significant (P = 0.000, for all). 3) The differences between grade II group and grade III group, and grade II group and grade IV group in mean MBV perimeter were significant (P = 0.000, for all), but no significant difference was seen between grade III group and grade IV group (P = 1.000). 4) In comparison with WHO pathological grade, the diagnostic coincidence rates of astrocytoma pathological grade II, III, and IV idemtified by FCM clustering method were 85.71%, 48.39%, and 78.95% respectively, and the total correct rate was 68.46%. Conclusion: The indexes of VEGF PU, MBV density and mean MBV perimeter in FCM clustering method relatively coincide with the pathological grades of astrocytoma. FCM clustering method can be an accessory inferential method for the pathological grading of astrocytoma. ; Endothelial growth factor, Fuzzy mathematics, Glioma, Immunohistochemistry,,,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84861514552

This study addresses the principal material transport mechanisms depending on parameters such as the expansion ratio, the expansion length, the fluid flow. Its design utilizes a double-L injection technique and combines the expansion chamber to minimize the sample leakage effect and to deliver a high-quality sample plug into the separation channel so that the detection performance of the device is enhanced. Experimental and numerical testing of the proposed microfluidic device that integrates an expansion chamber located at the inlet of the separation channel confirms its ability to increase the separation efficiency by improving the sample plug shape and orientation.

A nonlinear growth mixture model exhibits the different latent classes of evolution of the latent quantity underlying the correlated longitudinal markers and a logistic regression models the probability of occurence of the clinical event according to the latent classes. By introducing a flexible nonlinear transformation including parameters to be estimated between each marker and the latent process, the model also deals with non-Gaussian continuous markers. Through an application on cognitive ageing, the two advantages of the model are underlined: (1) the latent profiles of evolution associated with the clinical event are described including covariate effects in the longitudinal model but also in the probability of class membership and in the probability of occurence of the event, and (2) a diagnostic and a prognostic tools are derived from the model for early detection of the clinical event using any available information about the longitudinal markers.

A common assumption made in these studies is that higher levels of the biomarker are associated with increased disease risk. In this article, we consider methods of analysis in which monotonicity is incorporated in associating the biomarker and the clinical outcome. We consider the roles of discrimination versus association and assess methods for both goals. In addition, we propose a semiparametric isotonic regression model for binary data and describe a simple estimation procedure as well as attendant inferential procedures.

A number of different, and apparently divergent, methods for meta-analysis of diagnostic studies have been proposed, including two alternative approaches that are statistically rigorous and allow for between-study variability: the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (ROC) model (Rutter and Gatsonis, 2001) and bivariate random-effects meta-analysis (van Houwelingen and others, 1993), (van Houwelingen and others, 2002), (Reitsma and others, 2005). We show that these two models are very closely related, and define the circumstances in which they are identical.

Methods: A computer simulated model of cervical cancer was constructed and studies carried out using two policies and two scenarios. Policy 1 was for annual screening and Policy 2 for 3-yearly screening. The two scenarios assumed 54% (Scenario 1) and 100% (Scenario 2) attendance rates for screening. Results: The results from the simulation model indicated that annual screening resulted in fewer newly diagnosed cases of invasive cervical cancer and deaths from cervical cancer compared to 3-yearly screening for both scenarios. However, 3-yearly screening was found to be cheaper than yearly screening both in terms of total cost of screening and treatment, irrespective of the scenario. Policy 1 was more costly and less effective than policy 2 for 100% screening rates. Conclusion: As the annual screening rate for cervical cancer in Taiwan is presently around 30%, the model indicates that greater benefit would be achieved by increasing screening rates rather than increasing the frequency of screening. © The Journal on Information Technology in Healthcare 2007.,,article, cancer diagnosis, cancer growth, cancer invasion, cancer mortality, cancer regression, cancer screening, computer model, computer program, computer simulation, cost effectiveness analysis, health care cost, health care policy, outcome assessment, Papanicolaou test, patient compliance, Taiwan, uterine cervix cancer, uterine cervix carcinoma in situ, validation process,,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34247366357

Although many methods have been proposed to dichotomize prognostic variables, to date there has been no integrated method for polychotomization. The latter is necessary when dichotomization results in too much loss of information or when central values refer to normal states and more dispersed values refer to less preferable states, a situation that is not unusual in medical settings (e.g. body temperature, blood pressure). The goal of our study was to develop a theoretical and practical method for polychotomization. Methods: We used the overall discrimination index C, introduced by Harrel, as a measure of the predictive ability of an independent regressor variable and derived a method for polychotomization mathematically. Since the naive application of our method, like some existing methods, gives rise to positive bias, we developed a parametric method that minimizes this bias and assessed its performance by the use of Monte Carlo simulation. Results: The overall C is closely related to the area under the ROC curve and the produced di(poly)chotomized variable's predictive performance is comparable to the original continuous variable. The simulation shows that the parametric method is essentially unbiased for both the estimates of performance and the cutoff points. Application of our method to the predictor variables of a previous study on rhabdomyolysis shows that it can be used to make probability profile tables that are applicable to the diagnosis or prognosis of individual patient status. Conclusion: We propose a polychotomization (including dichotomization) method for independent continuous variables in regression models based on the overall discrimination index C and clarified its meaning mathematically. To avoid positive bias in application, we have proposed and evaluated a parametric method. The proposed method for polychotomizing continuous regressor variables performed well and can be used to create probability profile tables. © 2006 Tsuruta and Bax, licensee BioMed Central Ltd.,,article, controlled study, diagnostic test, health status, human, laboratory test, mathematical model, medical information, Monte Carlo method, multivariate logistic regression analysis, parametric test, prognosis, rhabdomyolysis, diagnosis, Monte Carlo method, multivariate analysis, predictive value, receiver operating characteristic, regression analysis, sensitivity and specificity, statistical analysis, statistical bias, Bias (Epidemiology), Data Interpretation, Statistical, Diagnosis, Humans, Monte Carlo Method, Multivariate Analysis, Predictive Value of Tests, Prognosis, Regression Analysis, ROC Curve, Sensitivity and Specificity ; 17169154,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33846484807

Two commonly used methods, empirical Bayes multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker (MGPS) and proportional reporting ratio (PRR), perform differently with respect to the number and types of signals detected. The goal of this study was to compare and analyse the performance characteristics of these two methods, to understand why they differ and to consider the practical implications of these differences for a large, industry-based pharmacovigilance department. Methods: We compared the numbers and types of signals of disproportionate reporting (SDRs) obtained with MGPS and PRR using two postmarketing safety databases and a simulated database. We recorded signal counts and performed a qualitative comparison of the drug-event combinations signalled by the two methods as well as a sensitivity analysis to better understand how the thresholds commonly used for these methods impact their performance. Results: PRR detected more SDRs than MGPS. We observed that MGPS is less subject to confounding by demographic factors because it employs stratification and is more stable than PRR when report counts are low. Simulation experiments performed using published empirical thresholds demonstrated that PRR detected false-positive signals at a rate of 1.1%, while MGPS did not detect any statistical false positives. In an attempt to separate the effect of choice of signal threshold from more fundamental methodological differences, we performed a series of experiments in which we modified the conventional threshold values for each method so that each method detected the same number of SDRs for the example drugs studied. This analysis, which provided quantitative examples of the relationship between the published thresholds for the two methods, demonstrates that the signalling criterion published for PRR has a higher signalling frequency than that published for MGPS. Discussion and conclusion: The performance differences between the PRR and MGPS methods are related to (i) greater confounding by demographic factors with PRR, (ii) a higher tendency of PRR to detect false-positive signals when the number of reports is small, and (iii) the conventional thresholds that have been adapted for each method. PRR tends to be more 'sensitive' and less 'specific' than MGPS. A high-specificity disproportionality method, when used in conjunction with medical triage and investigation of critical medical events, may provide an efficient and robust approach to applying quantitative methods in routine postmarketing pharmacovigilance. © 2006 Adis Data Information BV.

Novelli et al. (1996) proposed to use the proportion of heterotypic tumors among the tumors that are either heterotypic or pure and of the minority marker type as a lower bound on the marginal fraction of polyclonal tumors. Generally, Novelli's ratio does not provide a valid lower bound for the marginal polyclonal fraction, as we demonstrate by analyzing relevant conditional probabilities. Estimation of the polyclonal fraction requires modeling assumptions on the distribution of the number of involved clones. Using three elementary models, we develop maximum likelihood estimation of the polyclonal fraction. We establish robustness of our estimates to misspecification of the clone-marking process, though the estimates are sensitive to assumptions about polyclonal mechanisms. On data from several published studies, our estimates of the polyclonal fraction are substantially smaller than Novelli's ratio. © The Author 2006. Published by Oxford University Press.

Methods: We used data from 398 subjects from a prospective study on the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. Various diagnostic predictors or tests had (varying percentages of) missing values. Per method of handling these missing values, we fitted a diagnostic prediction model using multivariable logistic regression analysis. Results: The receiver operating characteristic curve area for all diagnostic models was above 0.75. The predictors in the final models based on the complete case analysis, and after using the missing-indicator method, were very different compared to the other models. The models based on MI did not differ much from the models derived after using single conditional and unconditional mean imputation. Conclusion: In multivariable diagnostic research complete case analysis and the use of the missing-indicator method should be avoided, even when data are missing completely at random. MI methods are known to be superior to single imputation methods. For our example study, the single imputation methods performed equally well, but this was most likely because of the low overall number of missing values. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The cancer burden is thus contributed by the same individuals from the diagnosis of cancer (incidence) until possible death from cancer (mortality). It would therefore be natural that predictions of future cancer burden, those needed by health administration, for example, could be based on individual data. This paper presents a new model for estimating future cancer burden, a model where individuals are followed from birth to death with or without a diagnosis of cancer. The model can formally be expressed as a summation of log-likelihoods of getting cancer and of surviving the cancer and other causes of death until death or censoring. The new model is illustrated with data of Finnish males with or without a diagnosis of lung cancer in calendar period 1987-1997. Incidence is modelled with a general age-cohort model with a drift and survival from cancer with a parametric mixture model. In a model for survival from other causes of death, selection of patients with respect to general population mortality is accounted for. Future cancer burden is illustrated with short-term predictions of prevalence and mortality.

(1999) Arch Gen Psychiatry 56:733-740] and others showing an increasing rate [e.g., Boydell et al. (2003) Br J Psychiatry 182:45-49]. Objective: This study examines (1) whether incidence rates are changing, (2) relationships amongst changing incidence rates and age, period and cohort effects, and (3) the impact of rate changes on rate projections. Design: A care-based cohort study carried out in British Columbia, Canada, 1989-1998. Bayesian statistical analyses were used to estimate rates and describe secular effects. Classical tests of significance were used to assess the relative importance of age, period and cohort effects. Results: Between 1989 and 1998, median rates per 100,000 persons changed from 77.1 (90% credible interval (CI): 42.1-137.7) to 89.9 (90% CI: 80.1-100.1) in females, and from 66.6 (90% CI: 38.8-113.3) to 119.6 (90% CI: 107.4-132.4) in males. Age effects were active for both males and females. Period and cohort effects were stronger for males than females. Conclusions: In contrast to most previous studies, we found an increasing incidence of schizophrenia.

One area of interest is to develop a general correlation modelling approach for high dimensional data with unbalanced hierarchical and heterogeneous data structures, e.g. multilevel data. Commonly used correlation structures might have limitation for such situations. In this paper, we propose two extensions, multiblock and multilayer correlations. These methods are very flexible in modelling correlation and can be incorporated in many multivariate approaches, while the major discussion focuses on the applications under the generalized estimating equations (GEE) methods. The approaches are especially useful in GEE when each cluster is large and complex but the number of clusters is small. If an incorrect correlation is applied to such data, the results are less efficient. Multiblock and multilayer correlations extend GEE methods to model complicated multilevel data with arbitrary number of levels and cluster size. The extended estimating equation for correlation parameters has an orthogonal property, and the computation is very efficient. A simulation study compares the conventional methods versus the proposed methods, and it shows the gain in relative efficiency and the flexibility in modelling various structures.

In a cross-sectional study, individuals who test positive are left-censored since we know only that the transition time is smaller than the monitoring time. Individuals who test negative are right-censored since we know only that the transition time is greater than the monitoring time. The transition time is not observed directly. For our method, we assume the hazard rate is well-defined after the time we start screening. We assume further the mortality rates for HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals are known. The method is illustrated using HIV-prevalence data collected over four years among women in Cape Town, South Africa.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A three-state Markov process was used to depict full clinical course. A total of 108 patients who underwent nonsurgical therapy as the first choice of treatment were derived from consecutive clinical series of patients registered in one medical center renowned for their use of percutaneous ethanol injection. RESULTS: We found that approximately 57.19% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 39.82%, 74.56%) patients were promptly responsive to initial treatment, whereas 43.81% had delayed response or were resistant to treatment. The rate of relapse (per month) was higher than the rate of remission (19.20% [95% CI: 15.36%, 23.04%] vs. 13.82% [95% CI: 10.72%, 16.93%]). The results from the multivariate analysis indicate that the significant predictors for the full clinical courses are total bilirubin, ?-fetoprotein, prothrombin time, globulin, tumor morphology, and alkaline phosphatase. CONCLUSIONS: A three-state remission-relapse-death model was proposed to quantify and ascertain the predictors for the multistate disease progression of small hepatocellular carcinomas treated by percutaneous ethanol injection. This model captures the risk of recurrence of tumor as well as the primary endpoint of death.

Increasingly, Markov models are being applied in medical and health services research and also in social sciences research. The purpose of our study was to use the Markov process to determine time-dependent transition probabilities for caries-free children to convert to a caries-active state and to assess the impact of salivary mutans streptococci (MS) levels on caries status. Methods: Our analysis was based on data obtained from a 6-year longitudinal study of risk factors associated with caries onset in children. Results: Based on a two-state Markov model, the probability that a caries-free child would convert to a caries-active state during the study ranged between 0.0046 and 0.0471. The highest probability of converting from a caries-free state to a caries-active state was 0.0471 at age 8.5 years. Conclusions: In addition to standard statistical methods of analyzing longitudinal caries data, Markov models show promise for use in the analysis of caries risk.

DNA from colorectal adenomas or carcinomas can be detected using specific mutations or methylation patterns. Altered DNA can in principle be detected in a high excess of normal DNA with high sensitivity, but low cost routine screening assays have yet to be developed. The combinaton of markers and methods must be refined to detect early stage tumours reliably. Only a test with high sensitivity could replace colonoscopy as the recommended screening method in the future. ; Cancer diagnosis, Colorectal carcinoma, DNA methylation, Gene mutation, Molecular medicine, Stool test ; article, colonoscopy, colorectal adenoma, colorectal carcinoma, DNA determination, DNA methylation, early diagnosis, feces analysis, gene mutation, human, intermethod comparison, methodology, mutational analysis, reliability, screening test, sensitivity analysis,,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34247551113

METHODS: Data from 244 patients treated for vulvar cancer at a single institution (Creteil, France) were used as a training set to develop and calibrate a nomogram for predicting relapse-free survival and local relapse-free survival. We used bootstrap resampling for the internal validation and we tested the nomogram on an independent validation set of patients (Torino, Italy) for the external validation. RESULTS: The nomograms were based on a Cox proportional hazards regression model. Covariates for the relapse-free survival model included age, T stage, number of metastatic nodes, bilateral lymph node involvement, omission of the lymphadenectomy, margin status, lymphovascular space invasion, and depth of invasion. The concordance indices were 0.85 and 0.83 in the training set before and after bootstrapping, respectively, and 0.83 in the validation set. The predictions of our nomogram discriminated better than did the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage (0.83 compared with 0.78, P = .01). The calibration of our nomogram was good. In the validation set, 2-year and 5-year relapse-free survival were well predicted with less than 5% difference between the predicted and observed survivals for each quartile. A nomogram for predicting local relapse was also developed. CONCLUSION: We have developed nomograms for predicting distant and local relapse of vulvar cancer at 2 and 5 years and validated them both internally and externally.

Selection of a single model fails to take into account the prior uncertainty in the model space. The Bayesian model averaging (BMA) approach tackles this problem by considering the set of all possible models. We apply BMA approach to the estimation of the false negative fraction (FNF) in a particular case of a two-stage multiple screening test for bowel cancer. We find that after taking model uncertainty into consideration the estimate of the FNF obtained is largely dependent on the covariance structure of the priors. Results obtained when the Zellner g-prior for the prior variance is used is largely influenced by the magnitude of g.

The critical value or cut-off is determined to optimize a trade off between sensitivity and specificity of the resulting test. When sampled units from a population are tested, they are allocated as either infected or not according to the test outcome. Units with values high above the cut-off are treated the same as units with values just barely above the cut-off, and similarly for values below the cut-off. There is an inherent information loss in dichotomization. We thus develop a diagnostic screening method based on data that are not dichotomized within the Bayesian paradigm. Our method determines the predictive probability of infection for each individual in a sample based on having observed a specific serologic test result and provides inferences about the prevalence of infection in the population sampled. Our fully Bayesian method is briefly compared with a previously developed frequentist method. We illustrate the methodology with serologic data that have been previously analysed in the veterinary literature, and also discuss applications to screening for disease in humans. The method applies more generally to a variation of the classic parametric 2-population discriminant analysis problem. Here, in addition to training data, additional units are sampled and the goal is to determine their population status, and the prevalence(s) of the subpopulation(s) from which they were sampled.

The study was performed in three institutions: a private clinic (A), a public hospital (B) and a private hospital (C). The incident air kerma to mammography procedures were estimated using a standard breast phantom and the patient MGD, evaluated in the units B and C, was performed using the calibration of output method. This method involves the recording of the patient exposure parameters (kVp, mAs, filter) and the measurement of these parameters of the incident air kerma using a calibrated ionisation chamber. The results obtained showed that INAK for the standard breast phantom, in the institutions A, B and C, were 18.2, 9.4 and 8.5 mGy, respectively. The results of patient MGD values ranged from 0.23 to 7.46 mGy per film, and the MGD values per woman were between 8.23 and 40.6 mGy for the C institution and between 1.50 and 18.78 mGy for the B institution. © The Author 2005.

We report results of follow-up biopsies in a recent cohort of community practice patients who underwent biopsy for PSA abnormalities. The study group consisted of 336 men with initial diagnoses of PIN (n = 204), ASAP (n = 78), or both lesions (n = 54) who underwent at least one repeat biopsy. Mean follow-up intervals in months were 6.0 for PIN, 3.8 for ASAP, and 4.9 for PIN/ASAP. Follow-up PCa detection rates were 23%, 37%, and 33%, respectively. The predictive value of ASAP was significantly higher than that for PIN (P = 0.0188). In 23 PIN studies with chronologic midpoints in the early 1990s, follow-up PCa was detected in a mean of 36% of cases, whereas this value was 21% after the year 2000. In 13 ASAP studies, mean PCa detection on follow-up was 45% until 1996 and 39% from 1997 to present. PIN/ASAP predicted PCa in 33% of cases in our study, similar to ASAP alone (P = 0.65) and had a mean predictive value of 44% in the literature. Factors that may account for the decline in PIN predictive values include: 1) extended biopsy techniques that yield higher rates of initial cancer detection, 2) lower detection rate for the remaining small cancers that may accompany PIN, and 3) remaining PIN cases may lack concomitant cancer.

This would be a valuable tool for clinicians in developing treatment plans for potential AD patients. Using the initial level and rates of change in visual memory performance, such a method could predict potential AD patients in a fast and inexpensive manner. A longitudinal case-control study of 52 female and 145 male participants was performed in a gerontology research center using premorbid tests of visual memory and neurologic examinations to identify individuals with and without dementia and AD. Methods: The classification method for each individual starts on the second examination and proceeds to compute that person's risk of AD one examination at a time based on all the follow-up information of the remaining individuals. Results: By performing a crossvalidation study, the optimal combination of sensitivity and specificity derived from a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed 65% of the Alzheimer cases and 75% of the noncases were correctly classified for females, while 65 and 60% of cases and noncases, respectively, were correctly classified for males. Conclusion: Longitudinal measurements of cognition can be useful in detecting the presence of AD. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

The focus is on the coordinated activities of the doctor and patient and the multitasking that is required during consultation. The data consists of primary care doctor-patient consultations for asthma and angina where clinical scenarios, supported by dummy electronic and paper records for use by the doctor, were played out. Although not 'naturally occurring', the mock scenario is a traditional medical training technique. Objective and methods: This paper describes and demonstrates a data transcription methodology, involving seven discrete levels of activities, developed to account for the intricate multitasking that occurs in a GP consultation. The transcription method, developed to support the evaluation of a prototype medical prescribing decision support system (Prodigy) for use by general practitioners in consultation with patients, builds on data description techniques from conversation analysis (CA) and video analysis (VA).

One approach to the joint analysis of survival and repeated measures data adopts a time-varying covariate regression model for the event time hazard. Using this standard approach, the instantaneous risk of death at time t is specified as a possibly semiparametric function of covariate information that has accrued through time t. In this manuscript, we decouple the time scale for modeling the hazard from the time scale for accrual of available longitudinal covariate information. Specifically, we propose a class of models that condition on the covariate information through time s and then specifies the conditional hazard for times t, where t > s. Our approach parallels the partly conditional models proposed by Pepe and Couper (1997, Journal of the American Statistical Association 92, 991-998) for pure repeated measures applications. Estimation is based on the use of estimating equations applied to clusters of data formed through the creation of derived survival times that measure the time from measurement of covariates to the end of follow-up. Patient follow-up may be terminated either by the occurrence of the event or by censoring. The proposed methods allow a flexible characterization of the association between a longitudinal covariate process and a survival time, and facilitate the direct prediction of survival probabilities in the time-varying covariate setting. ; Estimating equation, Joint model, Multivariate survival ; CD4 antigen, statistical analysis, survival, acquired immune deficiency syndrome, adult, article, bisexuality, data analysis, homosexuality, human, leukocyte count, longitudinal study, major clinical study, male, multivariate analysis, risk, seroconversion, statistical model, statistical parameters, survival, Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, Algorithms, Analysis of Variance, Antigens, CD4, Biometry, Data Interpretation, Statistical, HIV Seropositivity, Humans, Likelihood Functions, Longitudinal Studies, Male, Models, Statistical, Models, Theoretical, Multivariate Analysis, Proportional Hazards Models, Regression Analysis, Statistics, Survival Analysis, Time Factors ; 16011684,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-20744432583

The dose conversion factor (DCF), which gives the relationship between the effective dose and the potential alpha energy concentration of inhaled short-lived radon progeny (218Po, 214Pb, 214Bi/214Po) is estimated using a dosimetric approach related to the International Comission on Radiological Protection(1) (ICRP). The calculations are based on the measurements of the distribution of activity size of indoor radon progeny, their unattached fraction (fb) and potential alpha energy concentration (E). These experimental data are measured using a low- pressure cascade impactor and a wire-screen diffusion battery. Because of the short half-lives of the investigated nuclides, modifications that simplify the dose calculation are possible. The radioactive aerosol and biological parameters are varied in order to assess the DCF arising from the uncertainty of these parameters. The main emphasis is on the variation of the ventilation rate, breathing mode, critical cells for the induction of lung cancer and the parameters of the attached and unattached activity size distribution of the radon progeny. The investigation shows that the DCF is more than a factor of two higher than the values recommended by the ICRP(2), namely 3.9 mSv WLM-1 for the public and 5.1 mSv WLM-1 for working places. The dose results for indoor aerosol conditions are in the range 2.3-2.6 mSv WLM-1 depending on the breathing mode. © The Author 2004. Published by Oxford University Press.

Six hundred and sixty women, who had attended a colposcopy clinic and were invited to re-attend, completed the IPQ-R. Data were analysed using covariance structure analysis. The adequacy of an a priori confirmatory factor analytic model that included seven dimensions of the cognitive illness representation: identity, timeline-acute/chronic, serious consequences, personal control, treatment control, illness coherence, and causal attributions, and one emotional representation factor was tested against the observed data. After the elimination of two items responsible for large standardised residuals and with low factor loadings, the model adequately accounted for covariances among the IPQ-R items according to multiple criteria for goodness-of-fit. Factor inter-correlations supported the discriminant validity of the constructs and the factors exhibited satisfactory composite reliability. A theoretically predictable pattern of relationships among the representation dimensions was evident. In particular, the control-related constructs and the illness coherence dimension were negatively related to other illness representation constructs. The present study provided confirmatory evidence using a robust hypothesis-testing framework to support the proposed structure of the illness representation dimensions in a cervical screening context. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd. ; Colposcopy, Common-sense model, Illness cognitions, Self-regulation theory, Validity,,,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-16644388229

Methods: The population of automobile mechanics in France, according to profession and industrial sectors codes, was estimated from the data of the 1999 census. Risks were computed for a total male population of 242,360 automobile mechanics aged 16 to 60 years. Exposure to asbestos among these workers comes from maintenance tasks involving asbestos-containing parts produced before 1997 (date of the asbestos ban in France). Airborne asbestos concentration data available from the literature were highly variable. No data reporting the distribution of time spent for such tasks over a typical week of work were available. Therefore, different weekly exposure profiles were simulated, based on data from the 1994 SUMER survey. Risk models were those used for assessing asbestos health effects by all national and international agencies. Exposure scenarios mixed different levels of exposure, periods of time, proportions of exposed workers and dates of the natural disappearance of the automobile fleet built before asbestos was banned in brakes and other parts. The most realistic scenario hypothesizes that all automobile mechanics were exposed to asbestos, that the exposure levels ranged from 0.06 and 0.25 fibers/liter per week for the period before 1997, and between 0.01 and 0.06 fibers/liter per week afterwards until 2010. Results: According to this scenario, the number of lifelong cancer deaths (lung and pleura) induced by asbestos exposure in this population is estimated at 602 unavoidable cases, due to exposure experienced before 2003, 43 other cases will occur if asbestos is not removed from existing automobiles. © Masson, Paris, 2005. ; Asbestos, Automobile mechanics, Lung cancer, Pleural mesothelioma, Risk assessment ; asbestos, asbestos, adolescent, adult, article, cancer mortality, cancer risk, car, exposure, France, human, lung, lung cancer, major clinical study, male, mechanic, nonmedical occupations, pleura, pleura mesothelioma, population, population research, quantitative analysis, work, air pollutant, biological model, car, computer simulation, France, lung tumor, mesothelioma, middle aged, occupational disease, occupational exposure, pleura tumor, risk assessment, time, Adolescent, Adult, Air Pollutants, Occupational, Asbestos, Automobiles, Computer Simulation, France, Humans, Lung Neoplasms, Male, Mesothelioma, Middle Aged, Models, Biological, Occupational Diseases, Occupational Exposure, Pleural Neoplasms, Risk Assessment, Time Factors ; 16434923,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-27844556016

A community-based prospective study was conducted for over 8 years by record linkage to the Osaka Cancer Registry. The subjects were 1,927 individuals who were positive for anti-HCV through screening for second-generation HCV antibody (passive hemagglutination assay: ? 212) in voluntary blood donation. The risk factors for HCC and interaction between HCV and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection were evaluated by including additional blood donors: 2,519 individuals positive for hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) alone, 25 positive for both anti-HCV and HBsAg, 150,379 negative for both anti-HCV and HBsAg. The incidence of HCC (/10 5 person-years) among the HCV-positive individuals increased with age in both genders, ranging from 68 to 1,306 among those aged 45-74 years. In the HCV-positive individuals, the cumulative risk of developing HCC between the ages of 40 and 74 year was 21.6% among males and 8.7% among females. A stepwise increase in risk was noted as the serum alanine aminotransferase level increased or serum cholesterol level at baseline decreased in multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis. The 9-year cumulative incidence of HCC among individuals positive for HCV alone, those positive for HBsAg alone and those positive for both was 3.0%, 2.0% and 12.0%, respectively. The age-and-sex-adjusted rate ratio was 126, 102 and 572, respectively, when those negative for both were used as a reference. The results demonstrate an increased risk for HCC among asymptomatic HCV-positive individuals in japan.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The noise level in the raw scan data of 150 clinically indicated conventional tube current (200-320-mA) chest CT examinations was modified to simulate tube current reduction to 100 and to 40 mA. A total of 450 image sets were thus available. Four radiologists blinded to the tube current used assessed the image sets in random order for 14 structures and lung findings and ranked subjective image quality by using a five-point scale (1 = nondiagnostic, 2 = inferior, 3 = adequate, 4 = good, 5 = excellent). After a 3-week interval, the 150 conventional tube current image sets were rescored so that intraobserver agreement could be assessed. The McNemar statistic was used to determine whether there were more scoring disagreements between interpretations of the conventional and those of the reduced tube current scans or between the two interpretations of the conventional tube current scans. RESULTS: When overall agreement for 14 structures and lung findings was pooled over four observers, significantly more disagreements (P < .05) were seen when scores were compared between conventional and reduced tube current scans than when scores were compared between repeated interpretations of the conventional tube current scans. There was a significant decrease (P < .05) in the subjective image quality of reduced tube current scans compared with the subjective image quality of conventional tube current scans. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that reduced tube current does affect reader evaluation of structures and lung findings and reduces a reader's subjective assessment of image quality. © RSNA, 2004. ; Computed tomography (CT), image quality, Computed tomography (CT), radiation exposure, Radiations, exposure to patients and personnel, Thorax, CT ; contrast medium, ioversol, adolescent, adult, aged, article, computer assisted tomography, contrast enhancement, esophagus cancer, female, health care personnel, human, image quality, lung cancer, lung disease, lung metastasis, major clinical study, male, mediastinum mass, mesothelioma, priority journal, radiation dose, radiation exposure, radiology department, statistical analysis, thorax, Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Computer Simulation, Female, Humans, Lung Diseases, Male, Middle Aged, Observer Variation, Radiation Dosage, Tomography, X-Ray Computed ; 15284432,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-4143151587

There are 2 categories of confounding variables that pose special problems for studies of screening: (1) age and calendar time resulting from different temporal distributions of screening between cases and controls irrespective of whether the screening test leads to a reduction in mortality, and (2) the administration of other screening tests for the cancer in question when it is not clear whether the result of the other test had a bearing on the decision to order the test under study. We describe circumstances in which confounding from these sources can be dealt with satisfactorily by means of restriction or adjustment, and other circumstances in which it cannot.

How many additional cervical cancers would occur if annual screening reduced to screening 3 years after the last negative test? Study design. Outcomes analysis with Markov model using screening programme data. Main results. Among 32,230 women with ? 3 consecutive negative tests, none had cancer, 16 had grade 2 or three cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Among 938,576 women with no prior tests, 511 women had cancer. Cases were more common in women in whom fewer negative tests were performed. The model predicted that screening 3 years after the last negative test, rather than annually, would lead to five extra cases of cervical cancer in a cohort of 100,000 women aged under 30 years. Three extra cases among women aged 30-44 years, one extra case among women aged 45-59, and no additional cases among women aged 60-64, were predicted. Authors' conclusions.

Methods: Data from comprehensive health risk assessment (HRA) screening of 11 744 new enrollees (age ? 65 years) continuously enrolled in a Medicare HMO for at least 24 months between 1997 and 2002 were combined with complete healthcare service utilization data for each enrollee in the postenrollment period to create cost groups. An original clinically devised algorithm and a Classification and Regression Tree (CART) that used the HRA data were compared with respect to their ability to correctly place an individual within the cost groups over 12 months of enrollment. Results: The variables that best classified enrollees into 12-month cost groups included quality of life, age, and preenrollment health services. Classification was best for CART: a sensitivity of 39.8% and a specificity of 83% was achieved for very high cost enrollees. Compared with the clinical algorithm, CART also utilized only one third as many predictor variables to define risk categories. Conclusion: Brief self-report survey data collected at enrollment can be modeled to provide moderate sensitivity in predicting very high costs in the postenrollment year.

However, only very few people presently take access to this social measure. The ESPACES project developed and evaluated a procedure to identify retirees who have been exposed to asbestos during their career, and to inform them about the post-occupational medical follow-up program. Methods: This pilot study was performed within the health centers (Centres d'examens de sante (CES)) of the health insurance system in a random sample of men who have retired from the six main French administrative divisions between 1994 to 1996. A probability of exposure to asbestos was attributed through a job exposure matrix. Subjects were interviewed in the CES to validate their exposure data. Retired subjects with confirmed exposure to asbestos were referred to their CPAM, to apply for the medical follow-up. The whole process was evaluated through a comparison with control CPAMs, and simulations were performed to assess its sensitivity and specificity, as well as the total number of persons in France who could potentially benefit. Results: Among the 737 persons classified as exposed by the matrix who came to the CES, the exposure was confirmed for 53.8%, and 143 benefited from the medical follow-up, 17 times more than in a sample of control CPAMs. Based on an annual number of about 250,000 new retirees, simulations showed that a low detection threshold, taking into account the probability and duration of exposure, would yield approximately 25, 000 persons coming to the CES, more 6,000, of them benefiting from the follow-up. Conclusion: The proposed detection threshold would allow for a feasible and ethically acceptable generalization, due to the optimization of the false negative and false positive rate. ; Asbestos Exposure, Compensation Benefits, Job Exposure Matrices, Occupational Cancer, Occupational Diseases, Retired Workers ; asbestos, adult, article, follow up, France, health center, health insurance, human, law, major clinical study, occupational cancer, occupational disease, occupational exposure, pensioner, pilot study, sensitivity and specificity, simulator, workman compensation ; 15107689,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-1842680764

The proportion of individuals correctly certified as eligible is a function of the amount of error that exists in the dietary measures and the level of dietary intake used to establish eligibility. Whether individuals are correctly counselled to increase or decrease the consumption of selected foods or nutrients, is a function of the same factors. It is not clear, however, what percentage of individuals would be correctly classified under what circumstances. The objective of this study is to demonstrate the extent to which measurement error and eligibility criteria affect the accuracy of classification. Design: Hypothetical distributions of dietary intake were generated with varying degrees of measurement error. Different eligibility criteria were applied and the expected classification rates were determined using numerical methods. Setting and subjects: Simulation study. Results: Cut points of dietary intake at decreasing levels below the 50th percentile of true intake were associated with lower sensitivity and predictive value positive rates, but higher specificity and predictive value negative rates. The correct classification rates were lower when two cut points of dietary intake were used. Using a single cut point that was higher than the targeted true consumption resulted in higher sensitivity but lower predictive value positive, and lower specificity but higher predictive value negative. Conclusions: Current methods of dietary assessment may not be reliable enough to attain acceptable levels of correct classification. Policy-makers and educators must consider how much misclassification error they are willing to accept and determine whether more intensive methods are necessary. ; Certification, Measurement error, Misclassification, Nutrition counselling ; analytical error, article, data analysis, diet, diet supplementation, food composition, health care planning, human, patient coding, prediction, priority journal, Bias (Epidemiology), Computer Simulation, Diet, Eligibility Determination, Energy Intake, Food Services, Humans, Nutrition Assessment, Predictive Value of Tests, Sensitivity and Specificity ; 12795828,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037595472

Men with chronic renal failure evaluated for transplantation are often tested for prostate specific antigen (PSA) to detect prostate cancer. PSA occurs in several different molecular forms in serum: free PSA (fPSA) and complexed PSA (cPSA), the sum of which corresponds to total PSA (tPSA). In addition to tPSA, percent fPSA to tPSA (%fPSA) is widely used to enhance discrimination of benign disorders from prostate cancer. The low molecular mass of fPSA suggests elimination by renal glomerular filtration and that renal failure may significantly influence %fPSA. We evaluated whether established reference levels for %fPSA are applicable also to patients treated with haemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Methods. The study included 20 men on intermittent haemodialysis with low-flux membranes and 25 men on CAPD, without known history of prostate cancer. The control group included 3129 men without known prostate cancer. We analysed fPSA and tPSA in serum by dual-label immunofluorometric assays, from which we calculated %fPSA and cPSA. Serum levels of different PSA forms were adjusted for age and presented as geometric means. Results. Percent fPSA was significantly higher in patients on either haemodialysis (39.5%) or CAPD (39.6%) compared with controls (28.1%). Haemodialysis patients, but not CAPD patients, had significantly higher mean levels of fPSA. Levels of tPSA and cPSA for haemodialysis or CAPD patients did not differ significantly compared with controls. Conclusions. Recommended reference ranges for %fPSA, based on men with normal renal function, do not apply to uraemic men on dialysis. In these men, a high %fPSA should not be considered as a sign of benign disease. This is clinically important in the evaluation of dialysis patients for transplantation, as %fPSA is often used as a tool for detection of prostate cancer. ; Haemodialysis, Peritoneal dialysis, Prostate cancer, PSA, Renal failure, Renal transplantation ; dialysis fluid, dicea, gfs, pro, prostate specific antigen, sureflux, adult, age, aged, article, blood level, clinical feature, continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, controlled study, diagnostic value, dialysis membrane, differential diagnosis, fluorometry, glomerulus filtration rate, hemodialysis, human, immunoassay, kidney failure, kidney function, major clinical study, male, molecular weight, preoperative evaluation, priority journal, prostate cancer, prostate hypertrophy, uremia, urinary excretion, Adult, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Humans, Kidney Failure, Chronic, Kidney Transplantation, Male, Middle Aged, Peritoneal Dialysis, Continuous Ambulatory, Preoperative Care, Prostate-Specific Antigen, Prostatic Neoplasms, Reference Values, Renal Dialysis ; 12584285,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0347927256

To compare the ability of total prostate (TP) and transition zone (TZ) volume to predict the outcome of a repeat prostate biopsy in patients with serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels of 4 to 10 ng/mL. Methods. A total of 1137 patients were included and underwent transrectal ultrasound-guided needle sextant and two transition zone biopsies of the prostate. All patients with a prior negative biopsy (benign prostatic tissue) underwent a repeat biopsy after 6 weeks. The TP and TZ volumes of the prostate were measured by transrectal ultrasonography. Results. Of the 1137 patients, prostate cancer was diagnosed in 364 (32%), in 276 (24.2%) after the first biopsy and in 88 (7.7%) after the repeated biopsy. The TP and TZ volumes were larger in the patients with prostate cancer detected on the repeated biopsy (P &lt,0.0001). Using a cutoff for TP volume of less than 20 cm3 and greater than 80 cm3 and for TZ volume of less than 9 cm3 and greater than 41 cm3 would have spared 7.1% and 10% of repeated biopsies, respectively. Conclusions. The probability for a positive repeat prostate biopsy increases in a logarithmic function for larger prostates, as well as for larger TP and, especially, for larger TZ volumes. The probability of finding prostate cancer on a repeat biopsy in prostates with small (less than 20 cm3) and large (greater than 79 cm3) TP, as well as in small (less than 9.3 cm3) and large (greater than 41 cm3) TZ volumes, was very low. Therefore, a repeat prostate biopsy within 6 weeks is unnecessary. These patients should be followed up by serial PSA determination. © 2003, Elsevier Science Inc.,,prostate specific antigen, adult, aged, article, cancer diagnosis, controlled study, follow up, human, human tissue, major clinical study, male, organ size, priority journal, prostate, prostate biopsy, prostate cancer, transrectal ultrasonography, treatment outcome, Aged, Biopsy, Needle, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Models, Statistical, Probability, Prostate, Prostate-Specific Antigen, Prostatic Neoplasms ; 12559289,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037253569

This is a useful tool that gives us the information on the effects of health programs and of alternative options in terms of their costs, consequences and benefits. This is to clarify the present and future relationship between the input resources and economic effects of lung cancer control programs for developing evidence-based health policy and for improving the quality of health services. We developed a system model of cancer prognosis, similar to the Markov Model, and analyzed the balance of patient labor productivity (Benefit) and accumulated cancer care costs including screening costs (Cost). Such parameters as distribution of stages, probability of progress, 5-year-survival and medical costs of survivors were collected for the model. The cost-benefit ratios, expected survival years, costs per QALYs, costs of lifesaving, death rate (mortality/morbidity) and also the simulated future changes were calculated in the model. It costs 2-4 times in the lung cancer screening for the age of 40's in compared with that of 50's. The proportion of in total expenditure in lung cancer control program will be approximately 30-40% even in 2010, while the relatively better result from 50 to 70% will be appeared in other cancers. It was proven that the drastic increase of total medical costs in the future would hardly influence the balance itself. ; Cancer screening, Cost-benefit analysis, Economic evaluation, Lifesaving cost, System model ; article, cancer control, cancer mortality, cancer screening, cancer survival, cost benefit analysis, economic evaluation, economics, health care cost, health care policy, health care quality, health program, health service, lung cancer, morbidity, prognosis, quality adjusted life year,,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-2442562365

In this study, the implantation depth of 210Po was found by step-wise etching with two different etchants to obtain the depth distribution. The depth profiles are compared with results from simulations using the SRIM computer program. Theoretically estimated distributions showed good agreement with experimental 210Pb (or 210Po) activity depth profiles obtained by sequential etching. The maximum depth of implanted activity was about 100 nm, and activity deeper than about 70 nm is associated with the second alpha decay from 214Po activity previously implanted in the glass matrix. However, there was no depth interval where the activity was solely due to a single decay from the surface. The results also show that measurement of the depth profile for both old and controlled 222Rn exposure can potentially give important indications about the effects of cleaning and corrosion. ; 210Po, Computer calculations, Naturally occurring radionuclides, Radon ; glass, lead 210, polonium, radon 222, article, computer simulation, corrosion, decomposition, diffusion, human, implantation, priority journal, radiation dose distribution, radiation exposure ; 12498519,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037213307

To test this hypothesis, we analyzed serum proteomic mass spectra with a bioinformatics tool to reveal the most fit pattern that discriminated the training set of sera of men with a histopathologic diagnosis of prostate cancer (serum prostate-specific antigen [PSA] ?4 ng/mL) from those men without prostate cancer (serum PSA level <1 ng/mL). Mass spectra of blinded sera (N = 266) from a test set derived from men with prostate cancer or men without prostate cancer were matched against the discriminating pattern revealed by the training set. A predicted diagnosis of benign disease or cancer was rendered based on similarity to the discriminating pattern discovered from the training set. The proteomic pattern correctly predicted 36 (95%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 82% to 99%) of 38 patients with prostate cancer, while 177 (78%, 95% CI = 72% to 83%) of 228 patients were correctly classifled as having benign conditions. For men with marginally elevated PSA levels (4-10 ng/mL, n = 137), the specificity was 71%. If validated in future series, serum proteomic pattern diagnostics may be of value in deciding whether to perform a biopsy on a man with an elevated PSA level.,,prostate specific antigen, proteome, adult, article, bioinformatics, cancer diagnosis, controlled study, histopathology, human, hypothesis, major clinical study, male, mass spectrometry, medical decision making, prediction, priority journal, prostate cancer, protein blood level, sensitivity and specificity, tumor biopsy, Case-Control Studies, Chi-Square Distribution, Diagnosis, Differential, Humans, Male, Mass Spectrometry, Predictive Value of Tests, Prostate-Specific Antigen, Prostatic Diseases, Prostatic Neoplasms, Proteome, Tumor Markers, Biological ; 12381711,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037120949

Instead of using only total numbers of observed patients adjusted for the length of the observation period, we propose the use of (i) the time of the first contact of patients, (ii) the joint total numbers of patients and contacts, and (iii) the sets of patients in distinct time intervals, to generate prevalence rate estimates. The three new prevalence rate estimators have been developed assuming either a homogeneous or a parameterized heterogeneous patient population. Systematic and stochastic components of the estimators have been analysed by cross-validation for five chronic diseases using data from the Dutch 'Study on Chronic Conditions'. The results show that the first two estimators work well for diseases with a relatively structured visiting behaviour, such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus, assuming a time-constant contact rate and homogeneous patient population. For diseases such as ischaemic heart disease, chronic non-specific respiratory diseases and osteoarthritis, that do not satisfy these assumptions, the methods generally result in underestimations.

The approach is named memetic pareto artificial neural network (MPANN). Artificial neural networks (ANNs) could be used to improve the work of medical practitioners in the diagnosis of breast cancer. Their abilities to approximate nonlinear functions and capture complex relationships in the data are instrumental abilities which could support the medical domain. We compare our results against an evolutionary programming approach and standard backpropagation (BP), and we show experimentally that MPANN has better generalization and much lower computational cost.

Methods: The proposed strategy combines two data mining techniques: regression trees and regression analysis with optimal scaling (CATREG). The method traces small regression trees using the bootstrap and integrates the results as interaction variables (called trunk variables) into CATREG. Results: An application to data from cardiac patients shows a relative increase of 19% variance accounted for (16% cross-validated variance), by the CATREG model including the trunk variables compared to the model excluding these variables.

Case-control research is often exploratory, to determine factors that increase risk. Often, regression methods are used to determine combinations of risk factors that predispose to excess risk. Recently, tree-based methods have also been proposed. Both have limitations. An alternative approach is suggested, based on a search algorithm to identify at-risk subgroups. Methods. Statistical methods to determine and visualise at-risk sub-groups in case-control studies are presented. The method of determining sub-groups - search partition analysis (SPAN) - searches among different Boolean combinations of risk factors. Sub-groups that have been identified are visualised by scaled rectangle diagrams. These show the size of sub-groups and the extent to which they overlap. Results. Theory is presented for applying the method to case-control data. The methods are illustrated by analysis of three case-control studies: one on sudden infant death syndrome, a second on heart disease and a third on child pedestrian injuries. Conclusions. The methods provide a useful alternative to regression and tree-based analysis. They demarcate subgroups that, in the three examples, are easy to interpret and would not have been found by other methods.

To determine whether needle biopsy of the posterolateral aspects of the prostate aids in prostate cancer detection. In the routine sextant biopsy strategy, the posterolateral aspects of the prostate are not sampled. Methods. Using an 18-gauge biopsy gun, we performed sextant biopsies and an additional nine needle biopsies in the pathology laboratory on 150 radical prostatectomy specimens performed for Stage T1c prostate cancer. The additional nine biopsies consisted of three midline biopsies and six (three each from the left and right) posterolaterally aimed biopsies from the apex, mid, and base regions of the gland. Significant tumors were defined as those greater than 0.5 cm3, or with a Gleason score of 7 or greater, or non-organ confined. Results. Of the 123 cases with cancer on repeated biopsy, in only 3 (2.4%) was the only cancer found in the midline biopsies. For the following analysis, we analyzed the data as if we had not done the midline biopsies. If one had performed only the routine sextant needle biopsies, in 31 (25.2%) of the 123 cases, tumor would have been missed, 20 of these tumors were significant, including 5 with extraprostatic extension. If one had performed only the more posterolateral six biopsies, in 15 cases (12.2%), tumor would have been missed, 5 of these tumors were significant, all of which were organ confined. Conclusions. Adding routine midline biopsies does not appreciably increase the detection of cancer. If one were to only perform six needle biopsies of the prostate, these biopsies should be aimed more toward the posterolateral aspect of the gland.

Methods - The benefits of life years saved were weighted against the costs of biannual colonoscopy and proctocolectomy, and the terminal care of patients dying from colorectal cancer. Two separate Markov processes were modelled to compare the cost-benefit relation in patients with or without surveillance. The cumulative probability of developing colorectal cancer served as a threshold to determine which of the two management strategies is associated with a larger net benefit. Results - If the cumulative probability of colorectal cancer exceeds a threshold value of 27%, surveillance becomes more beneficial than no surveillance. The threshold is only slightly smaller than the actual cumulative cancer rate of 30%. Variations of the assumptions built into the model can raise the threshold above or lower it far below the actual rate. If several of the assumptions are varied jointly, even small changes can lead to extreme threshold values. Conclusions - It is not possible to prove that frequent colonoscopies scheduled at regular intervals are an effective means to manage the increased risk of colorectal cancer associated with ulcerative colitis. ; Cancer screening, Colorectal cancer, Health economics, Medical decision analysis, Surveillance colonoscopy, Ulcerative colitis ; article, cancer epidemiology, cancer risk, colonoscopy, colorectal cancer, cost benefit analysis, human, priority journal, proctocolectomy, terminal care, ulcerative colitis, Colitis, Ulcerative, Colonoscopy, Colorectal Neoplasms, Cost-Benefit Analysis, Decision Support Techniques, Feasibility Studies, Humans, Markov Chains, Mass Screening ; 10716679,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034068024

To compare the ability of different biopsy schemes to detect cancer and predict tumor volume using our previously described prostate biopsy simulation system. In addition, we used the simulation system to evaluate the optimal location of transition zone biopsies. Methods. Digital reconstructions of 180 radical prostatectomy specimens were used. Forty simulations were performed on each prostate for 10 biopsy schemes, including a previously reported five-region peripheral zone biopsy pattern and a new 11-core multisite-directed scheme consisting of sextant, two transition zone, one midline, and two anterior horn biopsies. For simulation of the transition zone biopsies, paired near-midline biopsies were simulated, with needle insertion points from the apex to the base of the prostate and with needle advances of 1 to 4 cm before firing. A total of 1,180,800 individual biopsy tracks were simulated. Results. The 11-core multisite-directed biopsy scheme had the highest detection rate for cancers greater than 0.5 cc. This scheme reliably detected cancer in 94% (138 of 147) of the cases. These results were significantly better than those of the sextant biopsy scheme (P <0.001) and the five-region 18-core peripheral zone scheme (P = 0.03). Compared with other schemes, there were increases in small-volume (0.5 cc or less) cancer detection by both the 11-core multisite-directed and five-region schemes, but they were not statistically significant. The multisite and the sextant plus four transition zone biopsy schemes had the best correlation of mean total core cancer length with total cancer volume. In the simulation of the transition zone biopsies, the highest detection rate was observed when the biopsies were initiated at the most apical section and inserted for a depth of 3 cm before firing. Conclusions. Our simulation results suggest that the detection rate of prostate biopsies is not related solely to the number of cores taken core placement (the regions of the prostate from which samples are taken) is also important. The 11-core multisite-directed biopsy scheme performed the best, with improved cancer detection rates and tumor volume correlation over other schemes.

It has been suggested that the lower detection rate for cancer in large prostates is due to the smaller proportion of tissue sampled. To examine this hypothesis, we evaluated whole-mount radical prostatectomy specimens in which the volume of cancer had been determined. We correlated cancer volume to overall gland volume, in addition, we performed stochastic computer simulations of parasagittal sextant biopsies on the same group of radical prostatectomy specimens. We correlated the likelihood of a positive cancer biopsy simulation with tumor volume and gland size. Methods. Six hundred seven tumor foci from 180 serially sectioned whole-mount prostatectomy specimens were mapped and digitized. Tumor volume was calculated by a step-section planimetry algorithm. Before sectioning, each gland was weighed. Systematic parasagittal sextant biopsies were computer simulated for each case. For each prostate, 40 simulations were performed, with random variations in biopsy location programmed for each run. Overall cancer detection by biopsy was considered positive if 90% of the 40 simulation runs were positive for cancer. Chi-square tests were used to evaluate statistical significance. Results. Small-volume cancers (0.5 cc or less) were twice as frequent in large glands greater than 50 g (P = 0.03). These small-volume tumors comprised 33% (13 of 40) of cancers in prostates greater than 50 g, 16% (5 of 31) in glands less than 30 g, and 14% (15 of 109) in glands 30 to 50 g. The rate of positive sextant biopsy simulation was lower in glands greater than 50 g than in glands 50 g or less (48% versus 67%, P <0.03). Smaller cancers were much less likely to be detected in the simulations. The simulation detection rate for cancers 0.5 cc or less was 18% (6 of 33), compared with a detection rate of 73% (107 of 147) for cancers greater than 0.5 cc (P <0.00001). Conclusions. The observed lower cancer detection rate in large glands is a result of the higher proportion of low- volume cancers in these glands. This suggests that large prostates are more likely to be biopsied because of an elevated prostate-specific antigen value resulting from benign elements of the gland and not from a significant cancer. Increasing the number of cores solely to compensate for increased prostate size risks a disproportionate increased detection of small-volume tumors with a low clinical likelihood of progression.,,prostate specific antigen, article, cancer diagnosis, cancer grading, disease course, priority journal, prostate, prostate biopsy, prostate cancer, prostate hypertrophy, prostatectomy, tumor localization, tumor volume, Biopsy, Computer Simulation, Humans, Male, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms ; 10197853,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033119075

STUDY DESIGN: Eight hundred fifty-six AutoCyte Preparation System from cervicovaginal samples were evaluated by AutoCyte- Screen. AutoCyte-Screen displayed 120 cell images and 6 low-power images for review by the cytotechnologist. The cytotechnologist classified the case as WNL, abnormal or unsatisfactory. AutoCyte-Screen then revealed its classification as either unsatisfactory, WNL, abnormal or undecided. These classifications were combined to form an interactive result that was compared to the diagnosis from previous manual review. RESULTS: Interactive results were as follows: 251 (29.3%) abnormal, 581 (67.9%) WNL and 24 (2.8%) unsatisfactory. The abnormal interactive result contained 15 ASCUS/AGUS and 25 SILs, the WNL interactive result contained 5 ASCUS/AGUS and 2 SILs. No ASCUS/AGUS or SILs were in the unsatisfactory interactive category. The false negative proportion was 10.5% for the interactive diagnostic method vs. 15.7% for manual review for LSIL. CONCLUSION: The interactive use of AutoCyte- Screen can effectively select those cases which are most likely to contain an epithelial abnormality and could therefore be used as a triage system to select cases for manual review. A case with an interactive result of unsatisfactory and abnormal should receive full manual review, while those classified as WNL may require a less extensive review for quality assurance purposes. This resultant decrease in the manual screening load could increase laboratory efficiency. ; AutoCyte Interactive Screening System, Cervical smears, Computer-assisted diagnosis, Mass screening ; article, computer assisted diagnosis, controlled study, female, human, human cell, image analysis, intermethod comparison, mass screening, Papanicolaou test, priority journal, quality control, uterine cervix cancer, uterine cervix cytology,,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032957184

Appropriate asymptotic (i.e., large sample) variance estimates and confidence intervals for the positive and negative agreement indices are presented and compared with bootstrap confidence intervals. We also discuss an alternative method of interval estimation motivated from a Bayesian viewpoint. The asymptotic intervals performed adequately for sample sizes of 200 or more. For smaller samples, alternative confidence intervals such as bootstrap intervals or Bayesian intervals should be considered. ; Agreement, Confidence intervals, Epidemiologic methods ; article, bayes theorem, human, observer variation, priority journal, probability, sample, simulation, statistical analysis, variance, Confidence Intervals, Epidemiologic Methods, False Positive Reactions, Humans, Observer Variation, Predictive Value of Tests, Reproducibility of Results ; 9731925,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032170639

To assess the relationship between tumor volume, gland volume, number of sectors submitted to biopsy, and prostatic biopsy detection rate. Methods. Using a three-dimensional mathematical model of the prostate, we assessed detection rates achieved with 4-, 6-, 8-, 10-, and 12-sector biopsies for glands ranging from 20 to 100 cc and peripheral zone tumors ranging from 0.3 to 1.4 cc. Results. Quadrant and sextant biopsy approaches only yielded from 6.2% to 13.4% and 8.6% to 18.3%, respectively, of lesions in a 40-cc gland. Conversely, 10- and 12-sector approaches yielded, respectively, from 19.8% to 48.8% and 25.4% to 62% of lesions for the same gland size. When assessed according to the density of sampling, one biopsy core used for every 1.5 to 3.5 cc of prostatic tissue detected 42.5% of 0.5- cc lesions. For the same lesion size, the density of sampling per biopsy core was then decreased to intervals extending from 3.6 to 7.5 cc, 7.6 to 12.5 cc, and 12.6 to 25 cc. These sampling density intervals yielded, respectively, 25.0%, 15.8%, and 9.8% detection rates. Conclusions.

Sixty eight Thai pre-and post-menopausal women with no previous HRT were recruited into the study. They were divided into 22 pre-menopausal women (group I), 28 post-menopausal women of ? 5 years (group II) and 18 post-menopausal women of > 5 years (group III). Their mean age was 48.2, 50.2 and 57.3 years, respectively. Myoma uteri was found in 10 (45.5%), 2 (7.1%) and 1 (5.6%) in group I, II and III. There were 2 (9.1%), 3 (10.7%), 3 (16.7%) cases of ovarian tumor in these three groups respectively. The detection rate of ovaries from ultrasound was 90.7 per cent in group I. 89.1 per cent in group II and III. The corpus to cervix ratio in the three groups was 2.3, 2.4 and 2.3, respectively. Uterine volume in nulliparous and multiparous pre-menopausal women was 56.6 ml and 74.2 ml, but in group II and III were 60.1 ml and 37.1 ml respectively.

Diagnostic likelihood ratios provide valuable information about the predictive properties of a diagnostic test while having the attractive feature of being independent of the prevalence of disease in the study population. We propose a new regression method that allows for direct assessment of covariate effects on likelihood ratios for binary diagnostic tests. This may be particularly useful in assessing how factors that are under the control of the clinician can be altered to maximize the predictive ability of the test. Similarly, patient characteristics that influence the ability of the test to discriminate between diseased and nondiseased subjects may be identified using the regression model. The regression method is flexible in that it can accommodate clustered data arising from a variety of study designs. We illustrate the method with data from an audiology study. ; Audiology, Bayes factor, Clustered data, Generalized estimating equations, Predictive value, Sensitivity, Specificity ; article, cluster analysis, data analysis, diagnostic accuracy, diagnostic test, regression analysis, Audiology, Epidemiologic Methods, Hearing Disorders, Humans, Likelihood Functions, Models, Statistical, Predictive Value of Tests, Regression Analysis, Reproducibility of Results ; 9629638,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031777501

We studied a sample of 786 patients with neurological disorders followed by the Neurological Department of Catania University and applied to them a four-step diagnostic protocol. Fifty-six per cent of the sample showed urological functional abnormalities, only 78 patients (9.9%) presented with an organic urological disease. Among the vesicosphincteric dysfunctions, bladder hyperreflexia was the most common pattern with remarkable differences between diseases.

However, its impact in different populations is uncertain. This study compares the changes in cervical cancer incidence at different ages after the introduction of screening in different populations, and addresses the impact of organized and opportunistic smear taking. We identified 17 cancer registries large enough and existing long enough to analyze screening effects. For each registry, we calculated the relative reduction in age-specific incidence rates and in incidence rates age-standardized to the world population after the introduction of cytologic screening, In 11 of the 17 populations, age-standardized incidence rates declined markedly from 27 percent in Norway and to 77 percent in Finland, Age-specific declines were confined to women aged 30 to 70 years old with a nadir around ages 40 to 55. In six other populations, age-standardized incidence rates declined less than 25 percent, an amount too small to provide unambiguous evidence of a screening effect. In several populations, cytologic screening had a more pronounced effect than is generally recognized. Because age-specific declines in cervical cancer incidence rates were strikingly similar in populations with widely different screening practices, organized screening may not be markedly superior to opportunistic screening. The reduction in reported cancer incidence because of screening is smaller in younger and older women. ; Cervical cancer, Incidence, Screening, World Health ; adult, age, article, cancer incidence, cancer invasion, cancer registry, controlled study, female, finland, human, major clinical study, norway, priority journal, screening, smear, uterine cervix cancer, Adult, Age Factors, Female, Humans, Incidence, Mass Screening, Middle Aged, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms, World Health ; 9328198,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030826230

To retrospectively study evaluated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and four PSA indices as criteria for performing a repeat biopsy when the initial biopsy findings are negative for cancer. Methods. One, two, or more repeat biopsy sessions were performed on 193, 54, and 14 men, respectively, all of whom had an initially negative biopsy at our institution. We compared the usefulness of PSA, PSA density, age-referenced PSA, volume-referenced PSA, and PSA velocity for predicting the presence of cancer. Results. Overall, 51 men (26%) were found to have cancer on repeat biopsy. Cancer was found in 17% (33 of 193) of the men on the first repeat biopsy and 26% (14 of 54) of the men who had a second repeat biopsy. Of all the indices, PSA and volume-referenced PSA had the highest sensitivity, missing the fewest cancers, however, this was achieved at the expense of saving the least number of biopsies. We evaluated the usefulness of indices among 9 patients who had a normal PSA at the initial biopsy, volume- referenced PSA was the earliest predictive index indicating that a repeat biopsy be performed. Analysis of the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curves revealed no significant advantage for any index over PSA alone in determining who should undergo a repeat biopsy. Conclusions. In determining the need for repeat biopsies, the established PSA threshold value of 4 ng/mL is equivalent or superior to age-referenced PSA, volume-referenced PSA, PSA density, and PSA velocity. However, volume-referenced PSA has the potential to be the earliest index predicting cancer in men with normal PSA level.,,prostate specific antigen, adult, aged, article, cancer cytodiagnosis, diagnostic value, human, human tissue, major clinical study, male, priority journal, prostate biopsy, prostate cancer, risk assessment, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Biopsy, Needle, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Predictive Value of Tests, Prostate, Prostate-Specific Antigen, Prostatic Neoplasms, Retrospective Studies, ROC Curve, Sensitivity and Specificity ; 9218021,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030809483

Research studies are required to define the statistical properties of such screening or diagnostic tests. However, statistical methodology currently used to evaluate diagnostic tests is limited. We propose the use of marginal regression models with robust sandwich variance estimators to make inference about the sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic tests. This method is more flexible than standard methods in that it allows comparison of sensitivity between two or more tests even if ail tests are not carried out on all subjects, it can accommodate correlated data, and the effect of covariates can be evaluated. This last feature is important since it allows researchers to understand the effects on sensitivity and specificity of various environmental and patient characteristics. If such factors are under the control of the clinician, it provides the opportunity to modify the diagnostic testing program to maximize sensitivity and/or specificity. We show that the marginal regression modelling methods generalize standard statistical methods. In particular, when we compare two screening tests and we test each subject with both screens, the method corresponds to McNemar's test.

We developed a stochastic computer simulation model of ultrasound guided biopsies using mathematically reconstructed radical prostatectomy specimens. Use of this technique allows rapid evaluation of a variety of factors for their effect on prostate biopsy results. We used this model to analyze the effectiveness of sextant biopsies, which have been widely adopted in clinical practice. We also analyzed other biopsy schemes. Materials and Methods: A total of 607 tumor foci from 180 serially sectioned whole mount radical prostatectomy specimens was mapped and digitized. The cancers had been clinically diagnosed by a variety of biopsy strategies. Simulated parasagittal sextant biopsies were performed for each case. Forty simulation runs (each consisting of a set of 6 biopsies) were performed for each prostate, with realistic random variations in sextant biopsy localization programmed in each run. Cancer detection by biopsy was considered reliable if 90% of the simulation runs for each prostate were positive for cancer. A summary algorithm was used to map the tumor foci. Results: Simulation of sextant biopsies demonstrated reliably detected cancer in only 107 of 147 patients (73%) in whom total tumor volume was greater than 0.5 cc. There was little correlation between total length of cancer in biopsy cores and tumor volume. Change of biopsy angle from 30 to 45 degrees did not result in significantly increased detection rates. Similarly, placing all biopsies more laterally did not increase overall detection rates. When we mapped tumor loci from the 40 cases in which sextant biopsies did not reliably detect tumor, we found that the foci were distributed in areas not biopsied by the sextant method, that is the transition zone, midline peripheral zone and inferior portion of the anterior horn of the peripheral zone. A 10-core biopsy scheme incorporating these areas as well as the posterolateral prostate reliably detected cancer in 141 of 147 patients (96%) with total tumor volumes greater than 0.5 cc. Conclusions: Prostate cancer of significant volume can be present in areas not sampled by standard sextant biopsies. Biopsies of the transition zone, midline peripheral zone and inferior portion of the anterior horn of the peripheral zone should be considered for re-biopsy strategy after negative sextant biopsies. Sampling of these additional areas also can be incorporated in an initial biopsy scheme to increase overall initial rates of detection of prostate cancer. ; Biopsy, Computers, Prostate, Prostatic neoplasms, Ultrasound ; algorithm, article, computer, computer simulation, echography, human, human tissue, male, priority journal, prostate biopsy, prostate cancer, prostatectomy, tumor volume ; 9366337,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030838288

Subjects-All cases of invasive cervical cancer registered with the East Anglian Cancer registry, diagnosed in the period 1971-93. Main outcome measures-Changing incidence of cervical cancer. Results-For the 20 years 1971-90, trends varied widely by district and by age group, with little discernible overall effect of the increasing screening activity. Since 1990, rates have fallen sharply in the age groups targeted for screening, with a reduction of 34% (95% confidence interval 26% to 42%) from that expected based on 1971-90 trends. This fall was preceded by a rapid rise in the national uptake of screening. A shift to more favourable stage at diagnosis has also occurred. Conclusion-Changes in the organisation and management of the national screening programme introduced in 1998 and 1989 seem to have led to substantial improvements in effectiveness. ; Incidence trends, Invasive cervical cancer ; adult, age distribution, aged, article, cancer incidence, cancer registry, cancer screening, cancer staging, female, health care organization, health program, human, major clinical study, outcomes research, statistical analysis, United Kingdom, uterine cervix cancer ; 9200063,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031395673

Artificial neural networks operate in two different learning modes: supervised in which a known diagnostic outcome is presented to the ANN, and unsupervised, in which the diagnostic outcome is not presented. A supervised learning ANN could emulate human expert diagnostic performance and identify relevant predictive markers in the diagnostic task, while an unsupervised learning ANN could suggest reasonable alternative diagnostic classification criteria. In the present study, we used ANN methodology to try to overcome the neuropathological difficulties in differentiating the subtypes of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and in differentiating PSP from postencephalitic parkinsonism (PEP) and corticobasal degeneration, or Pick's disease from corticobasal degeneration. First, we applied supervised learning ANN to classify 62 cases of these disorders and to identify diagnostic markers that distinguish them. In a second experiment, we used unsupervised learning ANN to investigate possible alternative nosological classifications. Artificial neural networks input data for each case consisted of values representing histological features, including neurofibrillary tangles, neuronal loss and gliosis found in multiple brain sampling areas. The supervised learning ANN achieved excellent accuracy in classifying PSP but had difficulty classifying the other disorders. This method identified a few features that might help to differentiate PEP, supported currently proposed criteria for Pick's disease, corticobasal degeneration and typical PSP, but detected no features to characterize the atypical subtype of PSP. In general, unsupervised learning ANN supported the present nosological classification for PSP PEP, Pick's disease and corticobasal degeneration, although it overlapped some groups. Artificial neural networks methodology appears promising for studying neurodegenerative disorders. ; Artificial neural networks, Dystal, Neurodegenerative disorders, Neuropathology, Progressive supranuclear palsy ; article, artificial neural network, cell loss, classification, degenerative disease, diagnosis, diagnostic accuracy, differential diagnosis, disease classification, encephalitis, extrapyramidal syndrome, gliosis, histology, human, learning, major clinical study, methodology, nerve cell, neurofibrillary tangle, parkinsonism, pattern recognition, pick presenile dementia, priority journal, progressive supranuclear palsy, Basal Ganglia Diseases, Computer Simulation, Humans, Learning, Neural Networks (Computer), Parkinson Disease, Software, Supranuclear Palsy, Progressive ; 8673495,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-8944263311

This is an encouraging but not altogether satisfactory development. Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are known to be potential agents in the etiology of cervical cancer. Therefore, an additional HPV test might well improve the detection rate of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). The purpose of this investigation was to compare the correlation of cytology and HPV testing in a pilot study of 94 women recruited from a clinic for sexually transmitted diseases after condyloma treatment and to check earlier established molecular biological assays. Cervical scrapings, taken for simultaneous Pap smear and molecular HPV DNA testing, were assessed by the polymerase chain reaction. Of the 94 women tested, 47 (50%) had normal cytology and negative HPV DNA, 36 (38%) had normal cytology but positive HPV DNA, 26 (72%) of whom harbored high-risk HPVs, 1 (1 %) had abnormal cytology but negative HPV DNA, and 10 (11%) had abnormal cytology and positive HPV DNA, 5 (50%) of whom harbored high-risk HPVs. It is concluded that an HPV test would add greater specificity and possibly also greater sensitivity to cytology for detecting or predicting high-grade CIN. This information may be of value when designing future gynecological screening programs. © 1996 S.

An investigation has been made into the differences between estimates for the duration of preclinical cervical cancer resulting from two types of studies. A median duration of 5-10 years was suggested by the observed build-up of incidence of invasive cervical cancer after one or more negative smears. Much longer median durations of more than 15 years have been reported from fitting statistical models to screening data.Methods. We developed one of these statistical models and fitted it to clinical incidence and screening data from British Columbia, which resulted in estimated mean durations of 12 years for pre-invaslve stages, and 4-5 years for screen-detectable stages. The model is used to predict the build-up of the incidence of invasive cancer after one and after two negative smears.Results. The model predictions appear to correspond closely to the observed incidence trends following negative smears. The apparent contradiction between model estimates and observed data is explained by recognizing that many of the women who have had negative smears will have further Pap smears, resulting in earlier diagnosis of invasive cervical cancers and thus an apparent faster build-up of the incidence.Conclusions. When the impact of further Pap smears is neglected, the data suggest that the risk of invasive cancer following one or more negative smears returns to close to prescreening levels within 6-10 years. This is an overestimation of the risk of clinical invasive cancer. In the case of cessation of screening it will take longer before the incidence of clinical cancer will increase. Where there is continuous screening the screen-detected cancers have a relatively favourable prognosis, thus contributing less to the senous morbidity and mortality risks associated with invasive cancer. This should be taken into account in making comparisons with the prescreening situation. © 1995 International Epidemiological Association.,,adult, article, canada, cancer incidence, cancer invasion, cancer mortality, cancer risk, disease duration, female, human, intermethod comparison, morbidity, papanicolaou test, patient attitude, priority journal, screening, statistical model, uterine cervix cancer, Adult, British Columbia, Carcinoma in Situ, Cervix Dysplasia, Cervix Neoplasms, Cohort Studies, Female, Human, Incidence, Mass Screening, Middle Age, Models, Theoretical, Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Time Factors, Vaginal Smears ; 7635589,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029002389

The most recent breast cancer data from the US National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program show that the incidence trend has slowed, while results from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) of 1987 and 1990 indicate that the percentage of women receiving mammograms continues to increase. This phenomenon suggested the need to reassess the relationship between increasingly early detection of breast cancer and overall incidence trends. A polynomial age-cohort model was used to establish the secular trend in incidence rates excluding the impact of recent increases in detection due to the rising use of mammography. Based on the model, the incidence trend in the youngest age group (40 to 49 years) would peak and then begin to decline in the early 1980s. This pattern would manifest itself later in successively older age groups as these younger cohorts age. Breast cancer trends are seen to be generally consistent with the impact of the increased use of mammography when its effect is superimposed upon the background of declining or slowing secular trends. These results support previous reports linking incidence rates with the increase in screening-mammography. © 1995 Rapid Communications of Oxford Ltd. ; Age-cohort model, breast cancer incidence, lead-time effect, screening-mammography, secular trend, United States ; age, article, breast cancer, cancer screening, dose time effect relation, female, human, mammography, priority journal, united states, Adult, Aged, Breast Neoplasms, Cohort Studies, Female, Human, Incidence, Mammography, Middle Age, Models, Statistical, United States ; 7749053,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028964970

The mean glandular dose D(G) results from the measured air kerma K(a) at the location of the entrance surface of the breast multiplied by the conversion factors g, which usually are calculated with the help of Monte-Carlo-Simulations and which are mostly given for a standard composition of tissue (50% glandular/50% adipose tissue). By means of the signals of the double-detector of the automatic-exposure-control of the mammographic device, it is possible to obtain information about the mean composition of the breast-tissue. The knowledge of this composition enables a better calculation of the mean glandular dose D(G) by using conversion factors that are adapted to the tissue. This method was applied to a total of 1020 women. The comparison with the evaluation by using the conventional method shows, on average, deviations in the mean glandular dose of 9%, in specific cases the differences can be as much as 35%. ; evaluation of mean glandular dose, mammography, radiation exposure, tissue composition ; adult, aged, article, breast, controlled study, dosimetry, female, human, major clinical study, mammography, radiation exposure, Breast, Breast Neoplasms, English Abstract, Female, Human, Mammography, Models, Anatomic, Monte Carlo Method, Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced, Radiometry, Risk Factors, X-Ray Intensifying Screens ; 8580142,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028825623

Strategies for both cost saving and effective implementation are however required for mass cervical screening in developing countries. In an early cancer detection programme conducted in South India, we analysed cytological abnormalities in 3602 women and correlated the results with other factors, including age, gynaecological complaints, number of years of married life and parity to see if pre?selection for cytologic screening was possible. Only lower grades of dysplasia were found in asymptomatic women below the age of 40 years. In asymptomatic women, malignancy and higher grades of dysplasia were confined to women with a clinically abnormal cervix only. Univariate analysis also revealed that subjects with a parity of more than 3 and a married life of more than 20 years had a significantly higher number of cytological abnormalities. However, on a multivariate analysis the increased number of marital years was not found to be an independent variable. These results suggest that asymptomatic women below the age of 40 years with a married life of less than 20 years and parity below 3, may be excluded from screening campaigns, and that pre?selection for cytologic screening is possible by introducing a programme of clinical and speculum examination of the cervix.

Smoking is a major attributable risk of lung cancer. Many other diseases, such as cardiovascular and chronic obstructive respiratory disease are also related to the smoking habit. The Japanese government and the public will have to pay more social cost of smoking in the future. We estimated the social cost of smoking from 1990 to 2030 through computerized simulation introducing effective variables to assess the costs, such as medical treatment, loss of life, fire, etc. The stochastic process called Ito process and financial engineering techniques are employed for making the model. The result showed that the social cost of smoking is expected to grow and reach 2.01 and 3.32 times in the year of 2010 and 2030, respectively. Fifty percent reduction of tobacco consumption could not reduce the social cost, which still climbs up to mark 1.58 in 2020. Should Japan succeed in reducing tobacco consumption by 20% per annum starting from 1996, the social cost would peak out at 1.30 in 2001 and come down to 0.93 in 2030. We estimate that 11 trillion yen (US$ 110 billion) per annum of social cost can be saved in and around 2030 in this case.

The approach is applied to longitudinal data collected over 4 years of follow-up from 450 men seropositive for the human immunodeficiency virus (90 AIDS cases) and 62 seroconverters (nine AIDS cases) participating in the Chicago part of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study. Because of the periodic nature of monitoring, the seroconversion time is interval-censored for seroconverters and left-censored for seroprevalent cohort members, the end-point is right-censored for 413 individuals. Since serological monitoring is not continuous but only at regularly scheduled visit times, a model for the discrete hazard rate (DHR) is proposed that is a generalized linear model that relates the DHR to the covariate history through the complementary log-log link. Classification trees are used for preliminary screening of covariates to identify predictors of AIDS that should be incorporated into the DHR model. The missing seroconversion times for all men are imputed 100 times to obtain 100 completed datasets from which the parameters of the DHR are then estimated using the maximum-likelihood method. The final DHR model includes the following infection progression (marker) variables: CD4%, hemoglobin, p24 antigen, and CD4% x p24 antigen interaction. Using this DHR model, the discrete survival distribution of AIDS-free time is estimated for the given population.

The radon entry rate is found to be a linear function of basement depressurization in this house which indicates that the flow of soil gas into the structure is laminar. The radon entry rates calculated before and after using a mitigation procedure is shown to provide a better measure of the mitigation efficacy than the standard before and after mitigation radon measurements in a research house. In addition, an analysis of the possible flow characteristics of soil gas and uncontaminated air into a basement indicates that any attempt to predict long-term average radon exposure from short-term screening measurements will only be possible under severely restricted conditions. © 1994 Health Physics Society Pergamon Press plc. ; Air sampling, Radon, Soil, Ventilation ; radon, article, building, calculation, control system, environmental exposure, gas flow, laminar flow, pressure gradient, priority journal, Air Pollution, Indoor, Atmospheric Pressure, Housing, Radon, Seasons, Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S. ; 8282559,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028012564

Information of smoking habits (never, current, and former smoking), occupation, length of education, and annual household income was obtained from 1,454 participants. Prevalence of smokers and socioeconomic status was inversely associated in Japan as well as in other developed countries. However, the association was not so strong as that in other countries.

Spontaneous screening tends to start and stop too early in a womanís life, and leaves too many women overscreened or unprotected. The combination in young age of a low incidence of invasive cancer and a high incidence of regressive lesions explains relative ineffectiveness and harmfulness of present screening practice. When screening would take place between ages 30 and at least 60, with intervals of about 5 years, as many lives could be saved for half the costs and with only 60% of the unnecessary referrals and treatments. Much attention should be paid to the coverage of the target population. Therapeutic follow-up policies for dysplastic lesions should be restrained. © 1992 Macmillan Press Ltd.,,adult, age, aged, article, cancer screening, cost benefit analysis, female, follow up, general practitioner, gynecology, human, major clinical study, netherlands, patient referral, priority journal, risk, uterine cervix cancer, uterine cervix cytology, Age Factors, Cervix Neoplasms, Cost-Benefit Analysis, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Human, Regression Analysis, Risk Factors, Vaginal Smears ; 1616867,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026694683

It presents a coherent strategy for dealing with qualitative descriptions of incomplete and uncertain knowledge, such as are commonly found in the medical domain. A description of how the hypergraph model may be embedded within a decision support system is given, and the performance of this system when applied to the problem of differential diagnosis in breast histopathology is discussed. A comparison is made between the hypergraph model and set covering model (as proposed by Reggia), illustrating the 'dual' nature of their relationship. The problem of ranking a set of diagnostic alternatives is explored using techniques taken from the theory of social choice. Finally, the possible areas in which the hypergraph model may be extended are discussed. © 1991. ; Differential diagnosis, hypergraphs, set covering, social choice theory, uncertainty management ; Biomedical Engineering--Diagnosis, Differential Diagnosis, Histopathology, Hypergraphs, Expert Systems, article, breast disease, computer, differential diagnosis, histopathology,,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026237451

Some are more dangerous than others and they appear to compete with each other for ? territory ?. The prospective use of vaccines and antiviral agents for HPV infection could disturb the balance of this ecosystem. This study derives the expressions for the prevalences of the different strains at equilibrium. The important parameters of these expressions are 1) the rate of change of sexual partner, 2) infectiousness on contact, and 3) the rates at which an infectious, immune phase decays to a non-infectious/immune phase, and then towards partial or full susceptibility to re-infection. The responses to changes in these parameters are investigated. Analysis shows that the balance between competing strains is locally and precariously stable, it can survive moderate inter-strain variations of the transmission and decay parameters, but larger differences, whether natural or artificially induced, can result in the rapid elimination of the disadvantaged strain. This might be exploited in a preventive programme. Conversely, if a harmless strain were eliminated, the harmful strains would fill the territorial gap, and the incidence of cervical cancer might increase. © 1988 Gustav Fischer. ; Cervical cancer, HPV types, Papillomavirus ; biometry, epidemiology, methodology, short survey, uterine cervix cancer, wart virus, Carcinoma, Squamous Cell, Cervix Neoplasms, Computer Simulation, Ecology, Female, Human, Models, Biological, Papillomavirus, Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Tumor Virus Infections ; 2833408,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0023942414

The appearance, in younger women, of a rapidly progressive form of cervical carcinoma has been suggested. This, together with evident deficiencies in the provision and technique of screening services, has been taken to indicate a need for more frequent screening. We show that a substantial increase in the observed number of such rapidly progressive cancers would be expected simply on the basis of changes in population structure, a general increase in cervical cancer rates and increases in the proportion of women screened.

The model makes no distributional assumptions about the underlying normal and abnormal patient populations or about the shape of the resulting ROC curves. In a computer simulation of 75 ROC curves, the model provides a fit equivalent to the maximum likelihood estimate method commonly used for ROC curve fitting. Similar results are obtained using the model to fit ROC curve data from the literature. The model's equation calculates the true-positive ratio as a function of the false-positive ratio, and has a first derivative that is useful for finding the optimal decision threshold for a diagnostic testing procedure. In particular, the model is useful in a computer program for finding jointly optimal thresholds for multiple sequential tests. © 1988, Sage Publications.

Quantitative knowledge of the natural history of cancer of the cervix is essential to the design of optimal screening programmes. We have estimated the incidence and prevalence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in a population of women receiving cytological examinations, and compared the results with those from other series. Relative risk of disease is reported in relation to easily identified variables (marital status, parity, contraceptive use, symptoms) which are likely to be of practical value in denning selective screening policies.

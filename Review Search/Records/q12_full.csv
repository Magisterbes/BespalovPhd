A cost-effectiveness analysis of adding a human papillomavirus vaccine to the Australian National Cervical Cancer Screening Program.;Kulasingam S1, Connelly L, Conway E, Hocking JS, Myers E, Regan DG, Roder D, Ross J, Wain G.;Sex Health. 2007 Sep.4(3):165-75.;Abstract BACKGROUND: The cost-effectiveness of adding a human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine to the Australian National Cervical Screening Program compared to screening alone was examined. METHODS: A Markov model of the natural history of HPV infection that incorporates screening and vaccination was developed. A vaccine that prevents 100% of HPV 16/18-associated disease, with a lifetime duration of efficacy and 80% coverage offered through a school program to girls aged 12 years, in conjunction with current screening was compared with screening alone using cost (in Australian dollars) per life-year (LY) saved and quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) saved. Sensitivity analyses included determining the cost-effectiveness of offering a catch-up vaccination program to 14-26-year-olds and accounting for the benefits of herd immunity. RESULTS: Vaccination with screening compared with screening alone was associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $51 103 per LY and $18 735 per QALY, assuming a cost per vaccine dose of $115. Results were sensitive to assumptions about the duration of vaccine efficacy, including the need for a booster ($68 158 per LY and $24 988 per QALY) to produce lifetime immunity. Accounting for herd immunity resulted in a more attractive ICER ($36 343 per LY and $13 316 per QALY) for girls only. The cost per LY of vaccinating boys and girls was $92 052 and the cost per QALY was $33 644. The cost per LY of implementing a catch-up vaccination program ranged from $45 652 ($16 727 per QALY) for extending vaccination to 14-year-olds to $78 702 ($34 536 per QALY) for 26-year-olds. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that adding an HPV vaccine to Australia's current screening regimen is a potentially cost-effective way to reduce cervical cancer and the clinical interventions that are currently associated with its prevention via screening alone.;Adolescent,Australia/epidemiology,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Decision Support Techniques*,Female,Human papillomavirus 16*,Humans,Markov Chains,Mass Vaccination/economics*,Mass Vaccination/statistics & numerical data,National Health Programs/economics,Papillomavirus Infections/economics*,Papillomavirus Infections/epidemiology,Papillomavirus Infections/prevention & control,Papillomavirus Vaccines/economics*,Papillomavirus Vaccines/therapeutic use,Quality of Life,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/economics*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control,Papillomavirus Vaccines;17931529;
A cost-utility analysis of cervical cancer screening and human papillomavirus vaccination in the Philippines.;Guerrero AM1, Genuino AJ1, Santillan M2, Praditsitthikorn N3, Chantarastapornchit V4, Teerawattananon Y5, Alejandria M6, Toral JA7.;BMC Public Health. 2015 Jul 30.15:730. doi: 10.1186/s12889-015-2046-1.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is the second leading cause of cancer cases and deaths among Filipino women because of inadequate access to screening and treatment services. This study aims to evaluate the health and economic benefits of HPV vaccination and its combination with different screening strategies to find the most optimal preventive strategy in the Philippines. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was conducted using an existing semi-Markov model to evaluate different screening (i.e., Pap smear, visual inspection with acetic acid) and vaccination strategies against HPV infection implemented alone or as part of a combination strategy at different coverage scenarios. The model was run using country-specific epidemiologic, cost and clinical parameters from a health system perspective. Sensitivity analysis was performed for vaccine efficacy, duration of protection and costs of vaccination, screening and treatment. RESULTS: Across all coverage scenarios, VIA has been shown to be a dominant and cost-saving screening strategy with incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) ranging from dominant to Php 61,059 (1443 USD) per QALY gained. VIA can reduce cervical cancer cases and deaths by 25%. Pap smear screening was found to be not cost-effective due to its high cost in the Philippines. Adding HPV vaccination at a cost of 54 USD per vaccinated girl on top of VIA screening was found to be potentially cost-effective using a threshold of 1 GDP per capita (i.e., Php 120,000 or 2835 USD/ QALY) with the most favorable assumption of providing lifelong immunity against high-risk oncogenic HPV types 16/18. The highest incremental QALY gain was achieved with 80% coverage of the combined strategy of VIA at 35 to 45 years old done every five years following vaccination at 11 years of age with an ICER of Php 33,126 (783 USD). This strategy may result in a two-thirds reduction in cervical cancer burden. HPV vaccination is not cost-effective when vaccine protection lasts for less than 20 years. CONCLUSION: High VIA coverage targeting women aged 35-45 years old at five-year intervals is the most efficient and cost-saving strategy in reducing cervical cancer burden in the Philippines. Adding a vaccination program at high coverage among 11-year-old girls is potentially cost-effective in the Philippines assuming a life-long duration of vaccine efficacy.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adolescent,Adult,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Early Detection of Cancer/economics,Female,Humans,Managed Care Programs/economics,Middle Aged,Papanicolaou Test/economics,Papillomavirus Infections/economics*,Papillomavirus Infections/prevention & control*,Papillomavirus Vaccines/administration & dosage,Papillomavirus Vaccines/economics*,Philippines/ethnology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/economics*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Vaccination/economics*,Vaccination/statistics & numerical data,Papillomavirus Vaccines;26223975;
Aspirin as an adjunct to screening for prevention of sporadic colorectal cancer. A cost-effectiveness analysis.;Ladabaum U1, Chopra CL, Huang G, Scheiman JM, Chernew ME, Fendrick AM.;Ann Intern Med. 2001 Nov 6.135(9):769-81.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Aspirin may decrease colorectal cancer incidence, but its role as an adjunct to or substitute for screening has not been evaluated. OBJECTIVE: To examine the potential cost-effectiveness of aspirin chemoprophylaxis in relation to screening. DESIGN: Markov model. DATA SOURCES: Literature on colorectal cancer epidemiology, screening, costs, and aspirin chemoprevention (1980-1999). TARGET POPULATION: General U.S. population. TIME HORIZON: 50 to 80 years of age. PERSPECTIVE: Third-party payer. INTERVENTION: Aspirin therapy in patients screened with sigmoidoscopy every 5 years and fecal occult blood testing every year (FS/FOBT) or colonoscopy every 10 years (COLO). OUTCOME MEASURES: Discounted cost per life-year gained. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: When a 30% reduction in colorectal cancer risk was assumed, aspirin increased costs and decreased life-years because of related complications as an adjunct to FS/FOBT and cost $149 161 per life-year gained as an adjunct to COLO. In patients already taking aspirin, screening with FS/FOBT or COLO cost less than $31 000 per life-year gained. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Cost-effectiveness estimates depended highly on the magnitude of colorectal cancer risk reduction with aspirin, aspirin-related complication rates, and the screening adherence rate in the population. However, when the model's inputs were varied over wide ranges, aspirin chemoprophylaxis remained generally non-cost-effective for patients who adhere to screening. CONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing colorectal cancer screening, aspirin use should not be based on potential chemoprevention. Aspirin chemoprophylaxis alone cannot be considered a substitute for colorectal cancer screening. Public policy should focus on improving screening adherence, even in patients who are already taking aspirin.;Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.,Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/economics,Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/therapeutic use*,Aspirin/economics,Aspirin/therapeutic use*,Colonoscopy/economics,Colorectal Neoplasms/epidemiology,Colorectal Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Decision Support Techniques,Humans,Markov Chains,Mass Screening/economics*,Occult Blood,Sensitivity and Specificity,Sigmoidoscopy/economics,Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal,Aspirin,M01-RR00042/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States,M01-RR00079/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States;11694102;
Association between human papillomavirus vaccine uptake and cervical cancer screening in the Netherlands: implications for future impact on prevention.;Steens A1, Wielders CC, Bogaards JA, Boshuizen HC, de Greeff SC, de Melker HE.;Int J Cancer. 2013 Feb 15.132(4):932-43. doi: 10.1002/ijc.27671. Epub 2012 Jul 3.;Abstract Several countries recently added human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination to cervical cancer screening in the effort to prevent cervical cancer. They include the Netherlands, where both programs are free. To estimate their combined future impact on cancer prevention, information is needed on the association between participation in vaccination now and in screening in the future and on what groups are at risk for nonparticipation. We studied the association between participation in screening by mothers and in vaccination by their daughters. Girls' vaccination status was matched by house-address with their mothers' screening participation. We estimated the effect on cancer incidence by means of computer simulation. We investigated risk groups for nonparticipation using multivariable multilevel logistic regression and calculated population-attributable fractions. Our results, based on 89% of girls invited for vaccination in 2009 (n = 337,368), show that vaccination status was significantly associated with mothers' screening participation (odds ratio: 1.54 [95% confidence interval: 1.51-1.57]). If a mother's screening is taken as proxy of a girl's future screening, only 13% of the girls will not participate in either program compared to 23% if screening alone is available. The positive association between vaccination and screening resulted in slightly lower model estimates of the impact of vaccination on cancer incidence, compared to estimates assuming no association. Girls with nonwestern ethnicities, with young mothers, who live in urban areas with low socioeconomic status, are at risk for nonparticipation. A significant part of potential nonscreeners may be reached through HPV vaccination. Estimates made before vaccination was introduced only slightly overestimated its impact on cervical cancer incidence.;Adolescent,Adult,Child,Early Detection of Cancer,Female,Humans,Middle Aged,Mothers,Netherlands,Nuclear Family,Papillomavirus Infections/prevention & control*,Papillomavirus Infections/virology,Papillomavirus Vaccines/administration & dosage*,Patient Participation*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/virology,Vaccination,Young Adult,Papillomavirus Vaccines;22689326;
Canada's Population Health Model (POHEM): a tool for performing economic evaluations of cancer control interventions.;Will BP1, Berthelot JM, Nobrega KM, Flanagan W, Evans WK.;Eur J Cancer. 2001 Sep.37(14):1797-804.;Abstract This paper describes the Population Health Model (POHEM) developed by Statistics Canada and shows its usefulness in the evaluation of cancer control interventions and policy decision-making. Models of the costs of diagnosis and treatment of lung and breast cancer were developed and incorporated into POHEM. Then, POHEM was used to evaluate the economic impact of chemotherapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer. reduced length of hospital stay following breast cancer surgery. and the provision of preventive tamoxifen to women at high risk of breast cancer. A lung cancer chemotherapy treatment decision framework was developed to rank order currently available chemotherapy regimens according to relative cost-effectiveness and cost-utility. Reducing post-surgical breast cancer hospitalisation with optimal home care support could produce major healthcare savings. However, the provision of preventive tamoxifen was estimated to have no population health benefit. This paper demonstrates that POHEM is an effective tool for performing economic evaluations of cancer control interventions and to inform healthcare policy decisions.;Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/economics,Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use,Breast Neoplasms/economics*,Breast Neoplasms/therapy,Canada,Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/economics*,Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/therapy,Cost of Illness,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Female,Health Care Costs,Humans,Length of Stay,Lung Neoplasms/economics*,Lung Neoplasms/therapy,Models, Econometric*,Monte Carlo Method,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,Tamoxifen/therapeutic use,Treatment Outcome,Tamoxifen;11549434;

Cost-effectiveness analysis of HPV vaccination alongside cervical cancer screening programme in Slovenia.;Obradovic M1, Mrhar A, Kos M.;Eur J Public Health. 2010 Aug.20(4):415-21. doi: 10.1093/eurpub/ckp208. Epub 2010 Jul 12.;Abstract BACKGROUND: The objective of the present study is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination alongside cervical cancer screening programme in Slovenia. METHODS: A previously published Markov model representing natural history of HPV infection was adapted to Slovenian context. The model followed a cohort of 12-year-old girls to 85-year-old women. Two strategies were compared: HPV vaccination alongside conventional cytological screening versus screening alone. Analysis was performed from the health care payer perspective. RESULTS: Vaccination with screening compared with screening alone was associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 23,178 EUR per quality adjusted life-year (QALY) gained and 54,536 EUR per life-year gained (LYG) at the discounting rate of 5%. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the ICER was most sensitive to the need for booster dose and to different values of discount rates. In case the booster dose was assumed 10 years after initial vaccination, the ICER value was increased to 58,690 EUR per QALY. On the other hand, using lower values of discount rates than the base case 5% significantly reduced the ICER value. CONCLUSION: According to the cost-effectiveness thresholds of 30,000 EUR per QALY which was adopted by the Health Council in Slovenia, HPV vaccination alongside screening programme can be regarded as cost-effective. However, cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination would become questionable in case a booster dose was needed to provide lifetime protection.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adolescent,Adult,Aged,Child,Cohort Studies,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Early Detection of Cancer/economics*,Female,Humans,Incidence,Markov Chains,Mass Screening/economics,Middle Aged,Papillomavirus Vaccines/economics*,Program Evaluation,Slovenia/epidemiology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control,Young Adult,Papillomavirus Vaccines;20624834;

Cost-effectiveness of human papillomavirus vaccination and screening in Spain.;Diaz M1, de Sanjose S, Ortendahl J, O'Shea M, Goldie SJ, Bosch FX, Kim JJ.;Eur J Cancer. 2010 Nov.46(16):2973-85. doi: 10.1016/j.ejca.2010.06.016. Epub 2010 Jul 16.;Abstract BACKGROUND: In Spain, prophylactic vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18 is being offered free-of-charge to one birth cohort of girls aged 11-14. Screening is opportunistic (annual/biannual) contributing to social and geographical disparities. METHODS: A multi-HPV-type microsimulation model was calibrated to epidemiologic data from Spain utilising likelihood-based methods to assess the health and economic impact of adding HPV vaccination to cervical cancer screening. Strategies included (1) screening alone of women over age 25, varying frequency (every 1-5 years) and test (cytology, HPV DNA testing). (2) HPV vaccination of 11-year-old girls combined with screening. Outcomes included lifetime cancer risk, life expectancy, lifetime costs, number of clinical procedures and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: After the introduction of HPV vaccination, screening will need to continue, and strategies that incorporated HPV testing are more effective and cost-effective than those with cytology alone. For vaccinated girls, 5-year organised cytology with HPV testing as triage from ages 30 to 65 costs 24,350¯õ? per year of life saved (YLS), assuming life-long vaccine immunity against HPV-16/18 by 3 doses with 90% coverage. Unvaccinated girls would benefit from organised cytology screening with HPV testing as triage. 5-year screening from ages 30 to 65 costs 16,060¯õ?/YLS and 4-year screening from ages 30 to 85 costs 38,250¯õ?/YLS. Interventions would be cost-effective depending on the cost-effectiveness threshold and the vaccine price. CONCLUSIONS: In Spain, inequitable coverage and overuse of cytology make screening programmes inefficient. If high vaccination coverage among pre-adolescent girls is achieved, organised cytology screening with HPV triage starting at ages 30 to at least 65 every 4-5 years represents the best balance between costs and benefits.

Cost-effectiveness of human papillomavirus vaccination in Belgium: do not forget about cervical cancer screening.;Thiry N1, De Laet C, Hulstaert F, Neyt M, Huybrechts M, Cleemput I.;Int J Technol Assess Health Care. 2009 Apr.25(2):161-70. doi: 10.1017/S0266462309090217.;Abstract OBJECTIVES: The cost-effectiveness of adding a human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination program in 12-year-old females to the recommended cervical cancer screening in Belgium is examined. Moreover, the health and economic consequences of a potential decline in screening uptake after initiation of a HPV vaccination program are investigated. METHODS: A static Markov model is developed to estimate the direct effect of vaccination on precancerous lesions and cervical cancers. RESULTS: Vaccination is estimated to avoid 20 percent of the cervical cancers occurring in a 12-year-old girls' cohort and to cost 32,665 euro per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained (95 percent credibility interval [CrI]: 17,447 euro to 68,078 euro), assuming a booster injection after 10 years, a limited duration of protection and discounting costs and effects at 3 percent and 1.5 percent, respectively. Assuming lifelong protection, HPV vaccination is estimated to cost 14,382 euro (95 percent CrI: 9,238 euro to 25,644 euro) per QALY gained, while avoiding 50 percent of the cervical cancer cases. In the base-case, a 10 percent reduction in screening compliance after vaccination obliterates the effect of vaccination on cervical cancer cases avoided, whereas further declines in the level of screening compliance even turned out to be detrimental for the cohort's health, inducing a mean loss in QALYs and life-year gained compared with the situation prevaccination. CONCLUSIONS: An HPV vaccination program should only be considered if the level of screening after vaccination can be maintained.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adolescent,Adult,Belgium/epidemiology,Child,Cohort Studies,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Female,Health Care Costs/statistics & numerical data,Humans,Markov Chains,Mass Screening/economics,Mass Screening/utilization,Papillomavirus Vaccines/administration & dosage,Papillomavirus Vaccines/economics*,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Vaccination/economics*,Papillomavirus Vaccines;19366497;

Economic evaluation of policy options for prevention and control of cervical cancer in Thailand.;Praditsitthikorn N1, Teerawattananon Y, Tantivess S, Limwattananon S, Riewpaiboon A, Chichareon S, Ieumwananonthachai N, Tangcharoensathien V.;Pharmacoeconomics. 2011 Sep.29(9):781-806. doi: 10.2165/11586560-000000000-00000.;Abstract BACKGROUND: The Thai healthcare setting has seen patients with cervical cancer experience an increasing burden of morbidity and mortality, a stagnation in the performance of cervical screening programmes and the introduction of a vaccine for the prevention of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify the optimum mix of interventions that are cost effective, from societal and healthcare provider perspectives, for the prevention and control of cervical cancer. METHODS: A computer-based Markov model of the natural history of cervical cancer was used to simulate an age-stratified cohort of women in Thailand. The strategy comparators, including both control and prevention programmes, were (i) conventional cytology screening (Pap smears). (ii) screening by visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA). and (iii) HPV-16, -18 vaccination. Input parameters (e.g. age-specific incidence of HPV infection, progression and regression of the infection, test performance of screening methods and efficacy of vaccine) were synthesized from a systematic review and meta-analysis. Costs (year 2007 values) and outcomes were evaluated separately, and compared for each combination. The screening strategies were started from the age of 30-40 years and repeated at 5- and 10-year intervals. In addition, HPV vaccines were introduced at age 15-60 years. RESULTS: All of the screening strategies showed certain benefits due to a decreased number of women developing cervical cancer versus 'no intervention'. Moreover, the most cost-effective strategy from the societal perspective was the combination of VIA and sequential Pap smear (i.e., VIA every 5 years for women aged 30-45 years, followed by Pap smear every 5 years for women aged 50-60 years). This strategy was dominant, with a QALY gain of 0.01 and a total cost saving of Baht (Bt) 800, compared with doing nothing. From the societal perspective, universal HPV vaccination for girls aged 15 years without screening resulted in a QALY gain of 0.06 at an additional cost of Bt 8,800, based on the cost of Bt 15,000 for a full immunization schedule. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, comparing HPV vaccinations for girls aged 15 years with the current national policy of Pap smears for women aged 35-60 years every 5 years, was approximately Bt 18,1000 per QALY gained. This figure was relatively high for the Thai setting. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that controlling cervical cancer by increasing the numbers of women accepting the VIA and Pap smear screening as routine and by improving the performance of the existing screening programmes is the most cost-effective policy option in Thailand.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Acetic Acid,Adolescent,Adult,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Female,Health Policy/economics*,Humans,Markov Chains,Mass Screening/economics,Mass Screening/methods*,Middle Aged,Models, Economic*,Papanicolaou Test,Papillomavirus Infections/prevention & control,Papillomavirus Infections/virology,Papillomavirus Vaccines/administration & dosage*,Papillomavirus Vaccines/economics,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,Thailand,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/economics,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Vaginal Smears/economics,Vaginal Smears/methods,Young Adult,Papillomavirus Vaccines,Acetic Acid;21838332;

Estimated effects of the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program on breast cancer mortality.;Hoerger TJ1, Ekwueme DU, Miller JW, Uzunangelov V, Hall IJ, Segel J, Royalty J, Gardner JG, Smith JL, Li C.;Am J Prev Med. 2011 Apr.40(4):397-404. doi: 10.1016/j.amepre.2010.12.017.;Abstract BACKGROUND: The National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP) provides breast cancer screening to medically underserved, low-income women aged 40-64 years. No study has evaluated NBCCEDP's effect on breast cancer mortality. PURPOSE: This study estimates life-years saved by NBCCEDP breast cancer screening compared with screening in the absence of NBCCEDP and with no screening. METHODS: A breast cancer simulation model based on existing Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network models was constructed. The screening module from these models was modified to reflect screening frequency for NBCCEDP participants. Screening data for uninsured women represented what would have happened without the program. Separate simulations were performed for women who received NBCCEDP (Program) screening, women who potentially received screening without the program (No Program), and women who received no screening (No Screening). The impact of NBCCEDP was estimated as the difference in life-years between the Program and No Program, and the Program and No Screening scenarios. The analysis was performed in 2008-2009. RESULTS: Among 1.8 million women who were screened between 1991 and 2006, the Program saved 100,800 life-years compared with No Program and 369,000 life-years compared with No Screening. Per woman screened, the Program saved 0.056 life-years (95% CI=0.031, 0.081) compared with No Program and 0.206 life-years (95% CI=0.177, 0.234) compared with No Screening. Per woman with invasive breast cancer and screen-detected invasive cancer, the Program saved 0.41 and 0.71 life-years, respectively, compared with No Program. CONCLUSIONS: These estimates suggest that NBCCEDP breast cancer screening has reduced mortality among medically uninsured and underinsured low-income women.

Evolution of multiple disease screening in Keelung: a model for community involvement in health interventions?;Wang PE1, Wang TT, Chiu YH, Yen AM, Chen TH.;J Med Screen. 2006.13 Suppl 1:S54-8.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: Screening for cancer and other chronic conditions tends to be conducted in independent programmes. that is, screening for one disease at a time. The Keelung community-based multiple disease screening programme, developed in Keelung city, Taiwan, is a notable exception. Here, we report on the Keelung programme's ethos and development within the community, focusing on equity of delivery of the service, and community involvement. In addition, we present some preliminary cost-effectiveness analyses of multiple disease screening. METHODS: The Keelung programme offers screening for breast, colorectal and liver cancers, cervical and oral neoplasia, all of which have an evidence base for their efficacy, and for diabetes, hypertension, osteoporosis and hyperlipidaemia, which are of unknown efficacy. We assessed variability of coverage rates of the Keelung Community-based Integrated Screening (KCIS) programme with age and socioeconomic status, availability of facilities for referral of positive screenees, and numbers of community social workers, general practitioners and local hospitals involved in the programme. We also assessed in qualitative terms how the programme interacts with non-health agencies. Finally, we simulated activities and costs for a variety of single- and multiple-disease screening situations. RESULTS: Between 1999 and 2003, coverage increased overall from 14.7 to 34.4%, and increased most dramatically in people aged 60-79 years (from around 30 to 60%) and in those of lower educational status (from around 40 to 70%). There was a significant growth in the involvement of social workers and volunteers in the programme, and an increase in the availability of local diagnostic and care facilities for those screened positive. In addition, there was substantial involvement of non-health agencies in publicizing the programme. In the health economic simulations, compared with no screening, the extra costs to gain an additional life year were estimated as 667 US dollars, 608 US dollars, 4227 and 4789 US dollars for multiple screening with 100% attendance, multiple screening with 70% attendance, single disease screening with 100% attendance and single disease screening with 30% attendance at each programme (i.e. 74% attendance for at least one out of four programmes), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The innovative design and outreach procedures of the KCIS have led to a growth in delivery of screening services to groups sometimes overlooked (equity), community involvement in health care (participation) and the use of non-health organizations for publicity and health education (collaboration).

Identifying target populations for screening or not screening using logic regression;Janes H., Pepe M., Kooperberg C., Newcomb P.;2005,Statistics in Medicine;Colorectal cancer remains a significant public health concern despite the fact that effective screening procedures exist and that the disease is treatable when detected at early stages. Numerous risk factors for colon cancer have been identified, but none are very predictive alone. We sought to determine whether there are certain combinations of risk factors that distinguish well between cases and controls, and that could be used to identify subjects at particularly high or low risk of the disease to target screening. Using data from the Seattle site of the Colorectal Cancer Family Registry, we fit logic regression models to combine risk factor information. Logic regression is a methodology that identifies subsets of the population, described by Boolean combinations of binary coded risk factors. This method is well suited to situations in which interactions between many variables result in differences in disease risk. We found that neither the logic regression models nor stepwise logistic regression models fit for comparison resulted in criteria that could be used to direct subjects to screening. However, we believe that our novel statistical approach could be useful in settings where risk factors do discriminate between cases and controls, and illustrate this with a simulated data set.

Introducing HPV vaccine and scaling up screening procedures to prevent deaths from cervical cancer in Japan: a cost-effectiveness analysis.;Yamamoto N1, Mori R, Jacklin P, Osuga Y, Kawana K, Shibuya K, Taketani Y.;BJOG. 2012 Jan.119(2):177-86. doi: 10.1111/j.1471-0528.2011.03036.x. Epub 2011 Jul 28.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of universal vaccination of 11-year-old girls against human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and increased screening coverage to prevent cervical cancer in Japan where the coverage of Papanicolaou smears is very low. DESIGN: A cost-utility analysis from a societal perspective. SETTING: Japan, 2010. POPULATION: The female Japanese population aged 11 years or older. METHODS: A Markov model of the natural history of cervical cancer was constructed to compare six strategies: i.e. a screening coverage rate of 20, 50 and 80% with and without routine vaccination at age 11. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cervical cancer incidence, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: Expanding the coverage of Papanicolaou smears from the current level of 20-50 and 80% yields a 45.5 and 63.1% reduction in cervical cancer incidence, respectively. Impact of combined strategies increases with coverage. Coverages of 20, 50 and 80% showed a 66.1, 80.9 and 86.8% reduction in disease, respectively. The costs of strategies with vaccination are four times higher than the cost of strategies without vaccination. Vaccinating all 11-year-old girls with bivalent vaccines with a Papanicolaou smear coverage rate of 50% is likely to be the most cost-effective option among the six strategies. CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of HPV vaccination in Japan is cost-effective as in other countries. It is more cost-effective to increase the coverage of the Papanicolaou smear along with the universal administration of HPV vaccine. ¯õ? 2011 The Authors BJOG An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology ¯õ? 2011 RCOG.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Child,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Early Detection of Cancer/economics*,Female,Humans,Japan/epidemiology,Papillomavirus Infections/economics*,Papillomavirus Infections/mortality,Papillomavirus Infections/prevention & control,Papillomavirus Vaccines/economics*,Prognosis,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,Risk Factors,Survival Rate,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/economics*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/mortality,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/virology,Vaccination/economics,Papillomavirus Vaccines;21794070;
Is human papillomavirus screening preferable to current policies in vaccinated and unvaccinated women? A cost-effectiveness analysis.;Accetta G1, Biggeri A, Carreras G, Lippi G, Carozzi FM, Confortini M, Zappa M, Paci E.;J Med Screen. 2010.17(4):181-9. doi: 10.1258/jms.2010.010019.;Abstract OBJECTIVES: Italy was the first European nation to offer free vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18. The vaccination is actively encouraged and is available free of charge to 11-year-old girls. The introduction of new technologies such as HPV DNA testing and HPV vaccination requires cost-effectiveness analysis of cervical cancer strategies in Italy for both vaccinated and unvaccinated women. METHODS: A calibrated Markov model was developed to describe the natural history of HPV infection and cervical carcinogenesis. We performed a microsimulation generating the life histories of 10 million women. Changes in these life histories occur as consequences of prevention strategies. We estimated costs of screening activities using an activity-based costing analysis. We assessed lifetime risk due to cervical cancer, lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-expectancy (QALE) for 18 scenarios. Strategies varied by screening interval (three and five years), primary and triage test (Pap test and HPV DNA test), and HPV 16 and 18 vaccination. RESULTS: The current screening policy (Pap test every three years) is more costly and less effective than HPV DNA test and Pap test triage every five years. For unvaccinated women an HPV DNA test every five years with a Pap test triage was cost-effective (ICER ¯õ?5753/QALE). Vaccination followed by the same screening strategy was cost-effective (ICER ¯õ?23,951/QALE) for women who are eligible to be vaccinated. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings strongly support changing the Pap screening policy to the use of HPV DNA as a primary test with Pap test triage for both vaccinated and unvaccinated women.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Female,Humans,Mass Screening/economics*,Middle Aged,Papillomavirus Infections/diagnosis*,Papillomavirus Infections/immunology,Papillomavirus Vaccines*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/virology,Vaginal Smears/economics*,Papillomavirus Vaccines;21258128;
Like mother, like daughter? Mother's history of cervical cancer screening and daughter's Human Papillomavirus vaccine uptake in Flanders (Belgium).;Lefevere E1, Hens N, Theeten H, Van den Bosch K, Beutels P, De Smet F, Van Damme P.;Vaccine. 2011 Oct 26.29(46):8390-6. doi: 10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.08.039. Epub 2011 Aug 19.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether and to what extent the uptake of the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine by girls aged 12-18 was related to the cervical cancer screening history of age-appropriate older female household members (assumed to be their mothers) in Flanders (Belgium). METHODS: We studied administrative records on 127,854 female members of the National Alliance of Christian Mutualities, which is the largest health insurance fund in Flanders. Reimbursement data for HPV vaccination of girls for the period 2007-2009 were linked with reimbursement data for cervical cancer screening of their mothers in the three preceding years. A multilevel logit model was used to study associations between both preventive behaviors. In the model we controlled for both the girl's and the mother's age, the province of residence and the socio-economic background of the family. RESULTS: A clear association between a mother's history of participation in cervical cancer screening and her daughter's HPV vaccination initiation was found. The conditional odds of HPV vaccination initiation were more than 4 times higher for girls whose mother had one Pap test than for girls whose mother had none (odds ratio [OR]=4.5. 95% confidence interval [CI]=3.5-5.9). For girls whose mother had three or more Pap tests, the conditional odds were 16 times higher than for girls whose mother did not have any pap tests ([OR]=16.0. 95% [CI]=12.1-21.2). The effect of screening (having received 1 pap smear as compared to none) was larger for girls living in neighborhoods with the lowest median income ([OR]=6.0, 95% [CI]=3.6-10.1). CONCLUSION: In a situation where both cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination are opportunistic, we found evidence that these preventive behaviors cluster within families.

Modeling the impact of treatment and screening on U.S. breast cancer mortality: a Bayesian approach.;Berry DA1, Inoue L, Shen Y, Venier J, Cohen D, Bondy M, Theriault R, Munsell MF.;J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr. 2006.(36):30-6.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Breast cancer mortality (BCM) in the United States declined from 33.1 per 100,000 women in 1990 to 26.6 per 100,000 women in 2000, yielding a 19.6% relative decline in BCM since 1990. Our goal is to apportion this decline between screening and therapy and to be able to state with some certainty that these interventions affected this decline. METHODS: We started with an age-appropriate population of 2,000,000 women in 1975 and monitored these women through 2000. On the basis of population data each year, we assigned screening and breast cancer to women. If a woman was diagnosed with breast cancer, we simulated a lifetime for her with death from breast cancer, and we modified this lifetime depending on the use of adjuvant therapy and whether the cancer was screen-detected. A woman's lifetime was taken as the minimum of her lifetime with death from breast cancer and her simulated natural lifetime. We used Bayesian simulation modeling, which allows for associating probability distributions with our estimates. RESULTS: We calculated the probabilities that screening mammography and adjuvant therapy contributed to the observed decline in BCM to be 90% and 99%, respectively. The posterior mean reduction in BCM due to screening is 10.6% +/- 5.7% and due to therapy is 19.5% +/- 5.4%. The decrease in the hazard of BCM due to tamoxifen use for ER-positive tumors is 37% +/- 14% and that due to adjuvant (nontaxane) chemotherapy is 15% +/- 14%. DISCUSSION: The spread in our posterior distributions reflect the uncertainty present in the data sources available to us. However, despite this uncertainty we conclude a high probability that both screening and improvements in therapy contributed to the reduction in BCM observed in the United States from 1990 to 2000.;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Age Distribution,Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use*,Bayes Theorem,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy*,Breast Neoplasms/mortality,Chemotherapy, Adjuvant,Cohort Studies,Cross-Sectional Studies,Female,Humans,Mammography/statistics & numerical data*,Mass Screening/statistics & numerical data*,Models, Statistical*,Predictive Value of Tests,Risk Factors,Sensitivity and Specificity,Survival Rate,United States/epidemiology,U01-CA88278/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,U01CA63731/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,U01CA63736/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,U01CA63740/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,U01CA69976/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,U01CA70013/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,U01CA70040/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,U01CA86076/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,U01CA86082/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;17032892;
Models of cervical screening in the era of human papillomavirus vaccination.;Canfell K1.;Sex Health. 2010 Sep.7(3):359-67. doi: 10.1071/SH10016.;Abstract Epidemiologic and economic evaluation using simulation modelling can support complex policy decisions, and is an important tool in predicting the future interaction between human papillomavirus vaccination and cervical screening. Several categories of screening program evaluation are of interest, including: (1) changes to screening considered over the short term, over which the effects of vaccination should be confined to the youngest age groups (<30 years old). (2) the medium and long-term effect of vaccination on the screening program. and (3) changes to screening in context of vaccination. This review considers some of the policy questions in each category and discusses the modelling implications, with particular focus on the Australian context.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adolescent,Adult,Age Factors,Aged,Australia,Child,Cross-Sectional Studies,Female,Humans,Mass Screening/utilization*,Mass Vaccination/utilization*,Middle Aged,Models, Theoretical*,Papillomavirus Infections/epidemiology*,Papillomavirus Infections/prevention & control*,Papillomavirus Vaccines/administration & dosage*,Program Evaluation/statistics & numerical data,Sexually Transmitted Diseases, Viral/epidemiology*,Sexually Transmitted Diseases, Viral/prevention & control*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Vaginal Smears/utilization*,Young Adult,Papillomavirus Vaccines;20719228;
Optimization of primary and secondary cervical cancer prevention strategies in an era of cervical cancer vaccination: a multi-regional health economic analysis.;Rogoza RM1, Ferko N, Bentley J, Meijer CJ, Berkhof J, Wang KL, Downs L, Smith JS, Franco EL.;Vaccine. 2008 Sep 15.26 Suppl 5:F46-58. doi: 10.1016/j.vaccine.2008.02.039.;Abstract With the recent advent of cervical cancer vaccines, many questions relating to the best overall prevention methods for cervical disease are beginning to arise. A Markov model was used across five geographic regions (Canada, The Netherlands, Taiwan, UK, US) to examine the clinical benefits and cost-effectiveness of: (1) vaccination combined with screening, considering changes to screening-related parameters and (2) vaccination combined with screening, considering changes to screening policy. Given the assumptions used in this analysis, adding vaccination to current screening is likely to be cost-effective in the regions studied. When considering vaccination with several plausible changes to screening programmes, locations with the most frequent Papanicolaou smear testing may achieve the most efficiency gains by adopting a less frequent screening interval or incorporating HPV testing into their screening practices. Although it may be beneficial to change screening to maximize efficiency, the most cost-effective strategies for vaccination and screening combinations may not lead to the greatest reductions in cervical cancer. therefore such policy decisions may vary depending on region-specific goals. Finally, new screening paradigms such as primary HPV testing should be considered in future analyses.;Female,Humans,Models, Econometric*,Papillomavirus Infections/economics*,Papillomavirus Infections/prevention & control*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/economics*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Vaccination/economics*;18992382;
Potential health and economic impact of adding a human papillomavirus vaccine to screening programs.;Kulasingam SL1, Myers ER.;JAMA. 2003 Aug 13.290(6):781-9.;Abstract CONTEXT: Recently published results suggest that effective vaccines against cervical cancer-associated human papillomavirus (HPV) may become available within the next decade. OBJECTIVE: To examine the potential health and economic effects of an HPV vaccine in a setting of existing screening. DESIGN, SETTING, AND POPULATION: A Markov model was used to estimate the lifetime (age 12-85 years) costs and life expectancy of a hypothetical cohort of women screened for cervical cancer in the United States. Three strategies were compared: (1) vaccination only. (2) conventional cytological screening only. and (3) vaccination followed by screening. Two of the strategies incorporated a vaccine targeted against a defined proportion of high-risk (oncogenic) HPV types. Screening intervals of 1, 2, 3, and 5 years and starting ages for screening of 18, 22, 24, 26, and 30 years were chosen for 2 of the strategies (conventional cytological screening only and vaccination followed by screening). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental cost per life-year gained. RESULTS: Vaccination only or adding vaccination to screening conducted every 3 and 5 years was not cost-effective. However, at more frequent screening intervals, strategies combining vaccination and screening were preferred. Vaccination plus biennial screening delayed until age 24 years had the most attractive cost-effectiveness ratio (44 889 dollars) compared with screening only beginning at age 18 years and conducted every 3 years. However, the strategy of vaccination with annual screening beginning at age 18 years had the largest overall reduction in cancer incidence and mortality at a cost of 236 250 dollars per life-year gained compared with vaccination and annual screening beginning at age 22 years. The cost-effectiveness of vaccination plus delayed screening was highly sensitive to age of vaccination, duration of vaccine efficacy, and cost of vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination for HPV in combination with screening can be a cost-effective health intervention, but it depends on maintaining effectiveness during the ages of peak oncogenic HPV incidence. Identifying the optimal age for vaccination should be a top research priority.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adolescent,Adult,Age Factors,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/pathology,Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/prevention & control*,Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/virology,Colposcopy/economics,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Disease Progression,Female,Humans,Life Expectancy,Markov Chains,Mass Screening/economics,Middle Aged,Models, Theoretical,Papillomaviridae*/immunology,Papillomaviridae*/isolation & purification,Papillomavirus Infections/pathology,Papillomavirus Infections/prevention & control*,Papillomavirus Vaccines*,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,Tumor Virus Infections/pathology,Tumor Virus Infections/prevention & control*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/pathology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/virology,Vaccination/economics*,Vaginal Smears/economics,Viral Vaccines/administration & dosage,Viral Vaccines/economics*,Papillomavirus Vaccines,Viral Vaccines;12915431;
Prevention of cervical cancer in rural China: evaluation of HPV vaccination and primary HPV screening strategies.;Canfell K1, Shi JF, Lew JB, Walker R, Zhao FH, Simonella L, Chen JF, Legood R, Smith MA, Nickson C, Qiao YL.;Vaccine. 2011 Mar 16.29(13):2487-94. doi: 10.1016/j.vaccine.2010.12.085. Epub 2011 Jan 4.;Abstract Comprehensive evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination in China has not previously been performed. The objective of this study was to evaluate vaccination as an alternative or addition to primary HPV screening with careHPV (Qiagen, Gaithersburg, USA), and to assess the threshold total cost per vaccinated girl (CVG) at which strategies involving vaccination would become viable compared to screening-only strategies in rural China. We used data from field studies in Shanxi Province to support modelling of HPV vaccination and screening, including local information on sexual behaviour, HPV prevalence, test accuracy, treatment protocols and costs. We evaluated several strategies involving screening once or twice per lifetime or at regular 5-yearly intervals, with or without vaccination of young females at age 15 years, assuming 70% coverage for both screening and vaccination. We also predicted cross-sectional cancer incidence each year to the year 2050 for a range of strategies. We found that strategies involving vaccination would be cost-effective at CVGs of US$50-54 or less, but at CVGs >$54, screening-only strategies would be more cost-effective. If vaccination of young cohorts is combined with two rounds of careHPV screening for women aged 30-59 years in 2012 and 2027, a predicted indicative 33% reduction in cervical cancer incidence by 2030 would be sustained until 2050, with incidence rates decreasing thereafter. In conclusion, taking into account estimated vaccine delivery costs (for 3 doses), a per-dose HPV vaccine cost of approximately <$9-14 would be required for strategies involving vaccination to be cost-effective. Overall, combined screening and vaccination approaches are required to maximise outcomes in rural China.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adolescent,Adult,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Child,China/epidemiology,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Female,Humans,Mass Screening/methods*,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical,Papillomaviridae/isolation & purification*,Papillomavirus Vaccines/immunology*,Rural Population,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Virology/methods*,Young Adult,Papillomavirus Vaccines;21211586;

The Effect of Treatment Advances on the Mortality Results of Breast Cancer Screening Trials: A Microsimulation Model.;Birnbaum J, Gadi VK, Markowitz E, Etzioni R.;Ann Intern Med. 2016 Feb 16.164(4):236-43. doi: 10.7326/M15-0754. Epub 2016 Jan 12.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Mammography trials, which are the primary sources of evidence for screening benefit, were conducted decades ago. Whether advances in systemic therapies have rendered previously observed benefits of screening less significant is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To compare the outcomes of breast cancer screening trials had they been conducted using contemporary systemic treatments with outcomes of trials conducted with previously used treatments. DESIGN: Computer simulation model of 3 virtual screening trials with similar reductions in advanced-stage cancer cases but reflecting treatment patterns in 1975 (prechemotherapy era), 1999, or 2015 (treatment according to receptor status). DATA SOURCES: Meta-analyses of screening and treatment trials. study of dissemination of primary systemic treatments. SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) registry. TARGET POPULATION: U.S. women aged 50 to 74 years. TIME HORIZON: 10 and 25 years. PERSPECTIVE: Population. INTERVENTION: Mammography, chemotherapy, tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors, and trastuzumab. OUTCOME MEASURES: Breast cancer mortality rate ratio (MRR) and absolute risk reduction (ARR) obtained by the difference in cumulative breast cancer mortality between control and screening groups. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: At 10 years, screening in a 1975 trial yielded an MRR of 90% and an ARR of 5 deaths per 10,000 women. A 2015 screening trial yielded a 10-year MRR of 90% and an ARR of 3 deaths per 10,000 women. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Greater reductions in advanced-stage disease yielded a greater screening effect, but MRRs remained similar across trials. However, ARRs were consistently lower under contemporary treatments. When contemporary treatments were available only for early-stage cases, the MRR was 88%. LIMITATION: Disease models simplify reality and cannot capture all breast cancer subtypes. CONCLUSION: Advances in systemic therapies for breast cancer have not substantively reduced the relative benefits of screening but have likely reduced the absolute benefits because of their positive effect on breast cancer survival.

The effects of population-based mammography screening starting between age 40 and 50 in the presence of adjuvant systemic therapy.;de Gelder R1, Heijnsdijk EA, Fracheboud J, Draisma G, de Koning HJ.;Int J Cancer. 2015 Jul 1.137(1):165-72. doi: 10.1002/ijc.29364. Epub 2014 Dec 13.;Abstract Adjuvant systemic therapy has been shown to be effective in reducing breast cancer mortality. The additional effect of mammography screening remains uncertain, in particular for women aged 40-49 years. We therefore assessed the effects of screening starting between age 40 and 50, as compared to the effects of adjuvant systemic therapy. The use of adjuvant endocrine therapy, chemotherapy and the combination of endocrine- and chemotherapy, as well as the uptake of mammography screening in the Netherlands was modeled using micro-simulation. The effects of screening and treatment were modeled based on randomized controlled trials. The effects of adjuvant therapy, biennial screening between age 50 and 74 in the presence of adjuvant therapy, and extending the screening programme by starting at age 40 were assessed by comparing breast cancer mortality in women aged 0-100 years in scenarios with and without these interventions. In 2008, adjuvant treatment was estimated to have reduced the breast cancer mortality rate in the simulated population by 13.9%, compared to a situation without treatment. Biennial screening between age 50 and 74 further reduced the mortality rate by 15.7%. Extending screening to age 48 would lower the mortality rate by 1.0% compared to screening from age 50. 10 additional screening rounds between age 40 and 49 would reduce this rate by 5.1%. Adjuvant systemic therapy and screening reduced breast cancer mortality in similar amounts. Expanding the lower age limit of screening would further reduce breast cancer mortality.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis,Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy,Breast Neoplasms/mortality*,Chemotherapy, Adjuvant*,Early Detection of Cancer/methods,Female,Humans,Mammography/methods*,Mass Screening,Middle Aged,Models, Biological,Netherlands,Survival Rate;25430053;
The impact of an imperfect vaccine and pap cytology screening on the transmission of human papillomavirus and occurrence of associated cervical dysplasia and cancer.;Malik T1, Reimer J, Gumel A, Elbasha EH, Mahmud S.;Math Biosci Eng. 2013 Aug.10(4):1173-205. doi: 10.3934/mbe.2013.10.1173.;Abstract A mathematical model for the natural history of human papillomavirus (HPV) is designed and used to assess the impact of a hypothetical anti-HPV vaccine and Pap cytology screening on the transmission dynamics of HPV in a population. Rigorous qualitative analysis of the model reveals that it undergoes the phenomenon of backward bifurcation. It is shown that the backward bifurcation is caused by the imperfect nature of the HPV vaccine or the HPV-induced and cancer-induced mortality in females. For the case when the disease-induced and cancer-induced mortality is negligible, it is shown that the disease-free equilibrium (i.e., equilibrium in the absence of HPV and associated dysplasia) is globally-asymptotically stable if the associated reproduction number is less than unity. The model has a unique endemic equilibrium when the reproduction threshold exceeds unity. The unique endemic equilibrium is globally-asymptotically stable for a special case, where the associated HPV-induced and cancer-induced mortality is negligible. Numerical simulations of the model, using a reasonable set of parameter values, support the recent recommendations by some medical agencies and organizations in the USA to offer Pap screening on a 3-year basis (rather than annually).

The impact of cytology screening and HPV vaccination on the burden of cervical cancer.;Tay K1, Tay SK.;Asia Pac J Clin Oncol. 2011 Jun.7(2):154-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1743-7563.2011.01396.x.;Abstract AIM: To evaluate the impact of different strategies of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination on the burden of cervical cancer in Singapore. METHODS: The incidence of cervical cancer was calculated using a Markov model with inputs based on Singapore data for the prevalence of HPV infection, socioeconomic characteristics and screening prevalence. The evaluation was performed for 10 scenarios: no screening, current opportunistic cytology screening, ideal optimal screening, universal adolescent HPV vaccination at 12-years old alone and with catch-up cohorts and combinations of screening and vaccination. RESULTS: (1) The model prediction showed that cervical cancer cases were reduced by 6.5% using opportunistic screening, by 34.3% using optimized screening and by 63.9% with a universal HPV vaccination at 12 years of age. (2) Adding optimized screening, but not opportunistic screening, to a universal adolescent HPV vaccination program caused a moderate further reduction in cervical cancer cases. (3) No difference was discernable in the impact of vaccination introduction between the age groups <20, 20-24 and 25-29 years old. (4) The time required to halve the incidence of cervical cancer was 42 years for universal vaccination at the age of 12 but could be shortened by including catch-up cohorts of women up to 40-years old. CONCLUSION: A universal HPV vaccination program introduced between the ages of 12-29 is superior to cytology screening in reducing the burden of cervical cancer. However, in the next four decades of post-vaccination era, optimizing the screening program remains the most important measure for cervical cancer prevention. ¯õ? 2011 Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.;Adolescent,Adult,Child,Cost of Illness,Female,Humans,Incidence,Markov Chains,Mass Screening/methods*,Papillomavirus Infections/epidemiology,Papillomavirus Infections/prevention & control,Papillomavirus Vaccines/therapeutic use*,Prevalence,Singapore/epidemiology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/virology,Vaginal Smears*,Young Adult,Papillomavirus Vaccines;21585695;

The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of adding HPV vaccination to the screening programme ranged from US $1078 to 1460 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained and US$3320-4495 per life year saved, mainly depending on whether the study was viewed from a health service or a societal perspective. Using discounted costs and benefits, the threshold analysis indicated that a vaccine price reduction of 60% or more would make the vaccine plus screening strategy more cost-effective than the screening only approach. To address the issue of affordability and cost-effectiveness, the pharmaceutical companies need to make a commitment to price reductions.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adolescent,Adult,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Female,Humans,Markov Chains,Middle Aged,Models, Economic*,Papillomavirus Infections/economics,Papillomavirus Infections/epidemiology,Papillomavirus Infections/prevention & control*,Papillomavirus Vaccines/economics*,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,South Africa/epidemiology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/economics,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Young Adult,Papillomavirus Vaccines;19698807;
The price of cancer screening;Lam C.L.K.;2004,Hong Kong Practitioner;Effectiveness of a screening test is an essential but not adequate criterion for its application to patient care. The potential benefit has to be balanced against the possible harm and cost of screening. This paper presents a framework on how the price can be balanced against the benefit of cancer screening. The principles are illustrated by modelling cervical cancer and breast cancer screening programmes in the setting of Hong Kong. The estimated price for every cervical cancer death prevented by regular smear screening is 1158 women suffering from psychological harm and HK$2,277,900. The estimated price for every breast cancer death prevented by regular mammography screening is 372 women suffering from psychological harm and HK$6,249,600. Breast cancer screening is about three times more costly than cervical cancer screening but it is associated with fewer women suffering from unnecessary psychological stress. The family doctor has a duty to counsel patients on not only the potential benefit but also the cost and possible harm of a cancer screening programme, so that patients can make truly informed choices.;,article, breast cancer, cancer mortality, cancer screening, cost benefit analysis, female, health care cost, health program, Hong Kong, human, informed consent, mammography, mental stress, outcomes research, patient care, uterine cervix cancer, uterine cervix cytology;;
The SPECTRUM population model of the impact of screening and treatment on U.S. breast cancer trends from 1975 to 2000: principles and practice of the model methods.;Mandelblatt J1, Schechter CB, Lawrence W, Yi B, Cullen J.;J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr. 2006.(36):47-55.;"Abstract OBJECTIVE: This stochastic simulation model was developed to estimate the impact of screening and treatment diffusion on U.S. breast cancer mortality between 1975 and 2000. MODELING APPROACH: We use an event-driven continuous-time state transition model. Women who are destined to develop breast cancer may be screen detected, present with symptoms, or die of other causes before cancer is diagnosed. At presentation, the cancer has a stage assigned on the basis of mode of detection. Cancers are assumed to be estrogen receptor (ER) positive or negative. Data on screening and treatment diffusion are based on national datasets. other parameters are based on a synthesis of the evidence available in the literature. MODEL METHODS: The model is calibrated to predict incidence and stage distribution (in situ, local, regional, and distant). Other than screening or treatment, background events that affect mortality are not explicitly modeled but are captured in the deviation between model projections of mortality trends and actual trends. We assume that: 1) tumors progress more slowly in older age groups, 2) screen- and clinically detected disease have the same survival conditional on age and stage, 3) women do not die of breast cancer within the ""lead time"" period, 4) screening benefits are captured by shifts in stage at diagnosis, 4) tamoxifen benefits only ER-positive women, and 5) preclinical sojourn time and dwell times in each of the clinical stages are stochastically independent. MODEL RESULTS: Dissemination of screening and therapeutic advances had a substantial impact on mortality trends. We estimate that, by the year 2000, diffusion of screening lowered mortality by 12.4% and treatment improvements and dissemination lowered mortality by 14.6%. CONCLUSIONS: Models such as this one can be useful to translate clinical trial findings to general populations. This model can also be used inform policy debates about how to best achieve targeted reductions in breast cancer morbidity and mortality.";Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Adult,Age Distribution,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use*,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy*,Breast Neoplasms/mortality,Chemotherapy, Adjuvant,Disease Progression,Female,Humans,Incidence,Mammography/statistics & numerical data,Mass Screening/statistics & numerical data*,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical*,Neoplasm Staging,Predictive Value of Tests,Sensitivity and Specificity,Stochastic Processes,Survival Rate,United States/epidemiology,K05 CA96940/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,U01-CA88293A/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;17032894;
The use of modeling to understand the impact of screening on U.S. mortality: examples from mammography and PSA testing.;Feuer EJ1, Etzioni R, Cronin KA, Mariotto A.;Stat Methods Med Res. 2004 Dec.13(6):421-42.;Abstract Surveillance data represent a vital resource for understanding the impact of cancer control interventions on the population cancer burden. However, population cancer trends are a complex product of many factors, and estimating the contribution of any one of these factors can be challenging. Surveillance modeling is a technique for estimating the contribution of one or more interventions of interest to trends in disease incidence and mortality. In this article, we present several approaches to surveillance modeling of cancer screening interventions. We classify models as biological or epidemiological, depending on whether they model the full unobservable aspects of disease onset and progression, or models which reduce the complex process to simpler terms by summarizing portions of the disease process using mostly observed population level measures. We also describe differences between macrolevel models, microsimulation models and mechanistic models. We discuss procedures for model calibration and validation, and methods for presenting model results which are robust with respect to certain types of biased model estimates. As examples, we present several models of the impact of mammography screening on breast cancer mortality, and PSA screening on prostate cancer mortality. Both these examples are appropriate uses of surveillance modeling, even though for mammography there is extensive (although somewhat controversial) randomized trial evidence, whereas for PSA this biomarker has seen extensive use as a screening test prior to any controlled trial evidence of its efficacy. Some of the models presented here were developed as part of the National Cancer Institute's Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network.;Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/mortality*,Female,Humans,Male,Mammography/utilization*,Models, Statistical*,Mortality/trends*,Population Surveillance,Prostate-Specific Antigen*,Prostatic Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Prostatic Neoplasms/mortality,United States/epidemiology,Prostate-Specific Antigen;15587432;
The value of male human papillomavirus vaccination in preventing cervical cancer and genital warts in a low-resource setting;Sharma M., Sy S., Kim J.J.;2016,BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology;Objective To estimate health benefits and incremental cost-effectiveness of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination of pre-adolescent boys and girls compared with girls alone for preventing cervical cancer and genital warts. Design Model-based economic evaluation. Setting Southern Vietnam. Population Males and females aged ?9 years. Methods We simulated dynamic HPV transmission to estimate cervical cancer and genital warts cases. Models were calibrated to epidemiological data from south Vietnam. Main outcome measures Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs): cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Results Vaccinating girls alone was associated with reductions in lifetime cervical cancer risk ranging from 20 to 56.9% as coverage varied from 25 to 90%. Adding boys to the vaccination programme yielded marginal incremental benefits (?3.6% higher absolute cervical cancer risk reduction), compared with vaccinating girls alone at all coverages. At ?25 international dollars (I$) per vaccinated adolescent (I$5 per dose), HPV vaccination of boys was below the threshold of Vietnam's per-capita GDP (I$2800), with ICERs ranging from I$734 per QALY at 25% coverage to I$2064 per QALY for 90% coverage. Including health benefits from averting genital warts yielded more favourable ICERs, and vaccination of boys at I$10/dose became cost-effective at or below 75% coverage. Using a lower cost-effectiveness threshold of 50% of Vietnam's GDP (I$1400), vaccinating boys was no longer attractive at costs above I$5 per dose regardless of coverage. Conclusion Vaccination of boys may be cost-effective at low vaccine costs, but provides little benefit over vaccinating girls only. Focusing on achieving high vaccine coverage of girls may be more efficient for southern Vietnam and similar low-resource settings.

Unifying screening processes within the PROSPR consortium: a conceptual model for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening.;Beaber EF1, Kim JJ2, Schapira MM2, Tosteson AN2, Zauber AG2, Geiger AM2, Kamineni A2, Weaver DL2, Tiro JA2. Population-based Research Optimizing Screening through Personalized Regimens Consortium.;J Natl Cancer Inst. 2015 May 7.107(6):djv120. doi: 10.1093/jnci/djv120. Print 2015 Jun.;Abstract General frameworks of the cancer screening process are available, but none directly compare the process in detail across different organ sites. This limits the ability of medical and public health professionals to develop and evaluate coordinated screening programs that apply resources and population management strategies available for one cancer site to other sites. We present a trans-organ conceptual model that incorporates a single screening episode for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers into a unified framework based on clinical guidelines and protocols. the model concepts could be expanded to other organ sites. The model covers four types of care in the screening process: risk assessment, detection, diagnosis, and treatment. Interfaces between different provider teams (eg, primary care and specialty care), including communication and transfer of responsibility, may occur when transitioning between types of care. Our model highlights across each organ site similarities and differences in steps, interfaces, and transitions in the screening process and documents the conclusion of a screening episode. This model was developed within the National Cancer Institute-funded consortium Population-based Research Optimizing Screening through Personalized Regimens (PROSPR). PROSPR aims to optimize the screening process for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer and includes seven research centers and a statistical coordinating center. Given current health care reform initiatives in the United States, this conceptual model can facilitate the development of comprehensive quality metrics for cancer screening and promote trans-organ comparative cancer screening research.

A cost-utility analysis of adding a bivalent or quadrivalent HPV vaccine to the Irish cervical screening programme.;;Eur J Public Health. 2010 Apr.20(2):213-9. doi: 10.1093/eurpub/ckp141. Epub 2009 Oct 28.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, and in Ireland it is the ninth most commonly diagnosed cancer in women. Almost 100% of these cancers are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Two newly developed vaccines against HPV infection have become available. This study is a cost-utility analysis of the HPV vaccine in Ireland, and it compares the cost-effectiveness profiles of the two vaccines. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis of the HPV vaccine in Ireland was performed using a Markov model. A cohort of screened and vaccinated women was compared with an unvaccinated screened cohort, and both cohorts were followed over their lifetimes. The model looked at uptake of services related to HPV disease in both cohorts. Outcomes were measured in quality adjusted life years (QALYs). Extensive sensitivity analysis was done. RESULTS: For the base case analysis, the model showed that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for quadrivalent HPV vaccination would be 25,349 euros/QALY and 30,460 euros/QALY for the bivalent vaccine. The ICER for the quadrivalent vaccine ranged from 2877 euros to 36,548 euros, and for the bivalent from 3399 euros to 45,237 euros. At current prices, the bivalent vaccine would need to be 22% cheaper than the quadrivalent vaccine in order to have equivalent cost effectiveness. CONCLUSION: HPV vaccination has the potential to be very cost effective in Ireland. The quadrivalent vaccine is more cost effective than the bivalent vaccine.;Cost-Benefit Analysis,Costs and Cost Analysis,Early Detection of Cancer/economics*,Female,Humans,Ireland,Markov Chains,Papillomavirus Infections/prevention & control*,Papillomavirus Vaccines/economics*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/virology,Vaccination/economics*,Papillomavirus Vaccines;19864366;
A cost-utility analysis of lung cancer screening and the additional benefits of incorporating smoking cessation interventions.;;PLoS One. 2013 Aug 7.8(8):e71379. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0071379. Print 2013.;Abstract BACKGROUND: A 2011 report from the National Lung Screening Trial indicates that three annual low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screenings for lung cancer reduced lung cancer mortality by 20% compared to chest X-ray among older individuals at high risk for lung cancer. Discussion has shifted from clinical proof to financial feasibility. The goal of this study was to determine whether LDCT screening for lung cancer in a commercially-insured population (aged 50-64) at high risk for lung cancer is cost-effective and to quantify the additional benefits of incorporating smoking cessation interventions in a lung cancer screening program. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The current study builds upon a previous simulation model to estimate the cost-utility of annual, repeated LDCT screenings over 15 years in a high risk hypothetical cohort of 18 million adults between age 50 and 64 with 30+ pack-years of smoking history. In the base case, the lung cancer screening intervention cost $27.8 billion over 15 years and yielded 985,284 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained for a cost-utility ratio of $28,240 per QALY gained. Adding smoking cessation to these annual screenings resulted in increases in both the costs and QALYs saved, reflected in cost-utility ratios ranging from $16,198 per QALY gained to $23,185 per QALY gained. Annual LDCT lung cancer screening in this high risk population remained cost-effective across all sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study indicate that repeat annual lung cancer screening in a high risk cohort of adults aged 50-64 is highly cost-effective. Offering smoking cessation interventions with the annual screening program improved the cost-effectiveness of lung cancer screening between 20% and 45%. The cost-utility ratios estimated in this study were in line with other accepted cancer screening interventions and support inclusion of annual LDCT screening for lung cancer in a high risk population in clinical recommendations.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Aged,Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/diagnosis*,Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/economics,Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/prevention & control,Computer Simulation,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Early Detection of Cancer/economics*,Female,Health Promotion/economics*,Humans,Lung Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Lung Neoplasms/economics,Lung Neoplasms/prevention & control,Male,Mass Screening/economics,Middle Aged,Models, Economic,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,Smoking/adverse effects,Smoking Cessation*;23940744;
Can a national lung cancer screening program in combination with smoking cessation policies cause an early decrease in tobacco deaths in Italy?;;Cancer Prev Res (Phila). 2012 Jun.5(6):874-82. doi: 10.1158/1940-6207.CAPR-12-0019. Epub 2012 Apr 23.;Abstract Objective is to predict smoking attributable deaths (SAD) for lung cancer and all causes in Italy, 2015 to 2040, assuming a yet unimplemented tobacco control policies (TCP) and a national, low-dose, lung cancer, computed tomography (CT) annual screening program (CT screen). A dynamic model describing the evolution of smoking habits was developed to estimate quit rates, 1986 to 2009, and to predict SAD under different scenarios: keeping the status quo. raising cigarette taxes by 20%. implementing cessation treatment policies (funding treatment, setting up an active quitline, promoting counseling among health professionals). introducing a three-round annual CT screen for current and former heavy smokers aged 55 to 74, 70% compliance, 20% lung cancer mortality reduction. combining all the above-mentioned measures. The CT screen brought a 3.0% constant annual reduction in lung cancer SAD and decreased or postponed all-cause SAD by 1.7% annually (a half due to respiratory diseases), relative to the status quo scenario. The effect was noticeable after few years from its introduction. TCP showed a steadily strengthening effect starting from 5 to 10 years after implementation. The lung cancer and all-cause SAD under cessation treatment policies, for instance, were reduced by 8.4% and 12.0% in 2030, respectively, and by 16.1% and 20.0% in 2040. TCP gave a greater effect than CT screen in reducing all-cause SAD because cessation brought about a reduction in smoking-related SAD other than lung cancer and respiratory diseases. Combining TCP and CT screen could bring about an early decrease in lung cancer and respiratory disease SAD due to CT screen, followed by a more substantial drop in all-cause SAD in subsequent decades due to TCP.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Aged,Early Detection of Cancer/methods*,Female,Humans,Italy,Lung Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Male,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical,National Health Programs/legislation & jurisprudence*,Prognosis,Risk Factors,Smoking/mortality*,Smoking Cessation*,Survival Rate,Tomography, X-Ray Computed;22525583;
Cost-effectiveness analysis of different types of human papillomavirus vaccination combined with a cervical cancer screening program in mainland China.;;BMC Infect Dis. 2017 Jul 18.17(1):502. doi: 10.1186/s12879-017-2592-5.;Abstract BACKGROUND: China has a high prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) and a consequently high burden of disease with respect to cervical cancer. The HPV vaccine has proved to be effective in preventing cervical cancer and is now a part of routine immunization programs worldwide. It has also proved to be cost effective. This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of 2-, 4-, and 9-valent HPV vaccines (hereafter, HPV2, 4 or 9) combined with current screening strategies in China. METHODS: A Markov model was developed for a cohort of 100,000 HPV-free girls to simulate the natural history to HPV infection. Three recommended screening methods (1. liquid-based cytology test + HPV DNA test. 2. pap smear cytology test + HPV DNA test. 3. visual inspection with acetic acid) and three types of HPV vaccination program (HPV2/4/9) were incorporated into 15 intervention options, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated to determine the dominant strategies. Costs, transition probabilities and utilities were obtained from a review of the literature and national databases. One-way sensitivity analyses and threshold analyses were performed for key variables in different vaccination scenarios. RESULTS: HPV9 combined with screening showed the highest health impact in terms of reducing HPV-related diseases and increasing the number of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Under the current thresholds of willingness to pay (WTP, 3 times the per capita GDP or USD$ 23,880), HPV4/9 proved highly cost effective, while HPV2 combined with screening cost more and was less cost effective. Only when screening coverage increased to 60% ~ 70% did the HPV2 and screening combination strategy become economically feasible.

Cost-effectiveness of a cervical screening program with human papillomavirus vaccine.;Sopina E1, Ashton T.;Int J Technol Assess Health Care. 2011 Oct.27(4):290-7. doi: 10.1017/S0266462311000456. Epub 2011 Sep 22.;"Abstract OBJECTIVES: Recent introduction of a quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine for girls in New Zealand is expected to decrease the incidence of HPV infection as well as resultant cytological abnormalities and cervical cancer. This may affect the cost-effectiveness of the national cervical screening program by reducing the incidence of lesions detected. This study investigates the cost-effectiveness of the current cervical screening policy with and without the HPV vaccine and compares these results with the cost-effectiveness of a range of other screening strategies. METHODS: A Markov state-transition model was built based on the natural history of HPV and cervical carcinogenesis. The model followed a hypothetical cohort of girls from 12 years to 85 years of age or death, through screening and treatment pathways. The model compared a ""no vaccine and current screening"" strategy with a selection of screening strategies with different age ranges and frequency intervals. RESULTS: The most cost-effective cervical screening strategy in the presence of the HPV vaccine would be screening women aged 30-60 every 5 years. Moving to this screening strategy from the base case of no vaccine and the current New Zealand strategy of screening women aged 20-69 every 3 years is predicted to have an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained of NZ$9,841 (¯õ?4,428). CONCLUSIONS: Reducing screening intensity from 3 to 5 years as well as narrowing the screening age range for the vaccinated cohort once they reach mid-twenties is recommended.

How does early detection by screening affect disease progression? Modeling estimated benefits in prostate cancer screening.;Wever EM1, Draisma G1, Heijnsdijk EA1, de Koning HJ1.;Med Decis Making. 2011 Jul-Aug.31(4):550-8. doi: 10.1177/0272989X10396717. Epub 2011 Mar 15.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Simulation models are essential tools for estimating benefits of cancer screening programs. Such models include a screening-effect model that represents how early detection by screening followed by treatment affects disease-specific survival. Two commonly used screening-effect models are the stage-shift model, where mortality benefits are explained by the shift to more favorable stages, and the cure model, where early detection enhances the chances of cure from disease. OBJECTIVE: This article describes commonly used screening-effect models and analyses their predicted mortality benefit in a model for prostate cancer screening. METHOD: The MISCAN simulation model was used to predict the reduction of prostate cancer mortality in the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) Rotterdam. The screening-effect models were included in the model. For each model the predictions of prostate cancer mortality reduction were calculated. The study compared 4 screening-effect models, which are versions of the stage-shift model or the cure model. RESULTS: The stage-shift models predicted, after a follow-up of 9 years, reductions in prostate cancer mortality varying from 38% to 63% for ERSPC-Rotterdam compared with a 27% reduction observed in the ERSPC. The cure models predicted reductions in prostate cancer mortality varying from 21% to 27%. CONCLUSIONS: The differences in predicted mortality reductions show the importance of validating models to observed trial mortality data. The stage-shift models considerably overestimated the mortality reduction. Therefore, the stage-shift models should be used with care, especially when modeling the effect of screening for cancers with long lead times, such as prostate cancer.;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Disease Progression*,Early Diagnosis,Humans,Male,Mass Screening/standards*,Models, Theoretical*,Prostatic Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Prostatic Neoplasms/pathology,U01 CA088160/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,U01-CA88160/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;21406620;
Modelling the impact of detecting and treating ductal carcinoma in situ in a breast screening programme.;McCann J1, Treasure P, Duffy S.;J Med Screen. 2004.11(3):117-25.;Abstract OBJECTIVES: Screening has substantially increased the detection of carcinoma in situ of the breast (CIS). Opinions vary as to whether this constitutes over-diagnosis or an opportunity to interrupt breast cancer's natural history. In England, incidence of invasive cancer and CIS increased in women of screening age (50-64 years), leading to a subsequent deficit in invasive incidence in women aged 65-69 years immediately beyond the invited age range. We aimed to model underlying incidence of invasive cancer and CIS expected in the absence of screening, and to quantify the likely relative contributions of their early detection to the observed reduction in invasive cancer in women of postscreening age. SETTING: UK NHS breast screening programme in England. METHODS: Poisson regression modelling was used to establish the underlying incidence of invasive and in situ cancers in the absence of screening. We then estimated age- and year-specific excess detection rates attributable to screening. Applying these to population figures we estimated conservatively the relative contributions of early diagnosis of CIS and invasive cancer at 50-64 years of age to the subsequent deficit in invasive cancer in women beyond invitation age (65-69 years), for screening early in the programme and at steady state. RESULTS: Our model estimated a 1.6% annual increase in incidence, giving an estimated deficit of 4.22 invasive cancers per 10,000 women aged 65-69 years in 1996. Carcinoma in situ contributed 13-17% to the deficit, assuming a mean six year lead time and 75-100% progression to invasive cancer. At steady state, with current screening performance and with lead times of 3-4 years (invasive cancer) and 6-9 years (CIS), invasive incidence might be reduced by 5-6 cancers per 10,000 women aged 65-69 years in 2010 (15-20% of underlying incidence), CIS contributing 20-40%. DISCUSSION: The longer lead time associated with CIS attenuates the impact its early detection has on subsequent invasive incidence. At steady state screening, its detection contributes significantly to the deficit in invasive incidence. Our results suggest that, cancer for cancer, there may be just as much benefit in detecting and treating a case of CIS as there is in treating a case of invasive cancer.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Aged,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Carcinoma in Situ/epidemiology*,Carcinoma, Ductal/epidemiology*,England/epidemiology,Female,Humans,Incidence,Mass Screening,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical,Neoplasm Invasiveness,Poisson Distribution,State Medicine;15333269;
Overdiagnosis and overtreatment of breast cancer: microsimulation modelling estimates based on observed screen and clinical data.;de Koning HJ1, Draisma G, Fracheboud J, de Bruijn A.;Breast Cancer Res. 2006.8(1):202. Epub 2005 Dec 21.;Abstract There is a delicate balance between the favourable and unfavourable side-effects of screening in general. Overdiagnosis, the detection of breast cancers by screening that would otherwise never have been clinically diagnosed but are now consequently treated, is such an unfavourable side effect. To correctly model the natural history of breast cancer, one has to estimate mean durations of the different pre-clinical phases, transition probabilities to clinical cancer stages, and sensitivity of the applied test based on observed screen and clinical data. The Dutch data clearly show an increase in screen-detected cases in the 50 to 74 year old age group since the introduction of screening, and a decline in incidence around age 80 years. We had estimated that 3% of total incidence would otherwise not have been diagnosed clinically. This magnitude is no reason not to offer screening for women aged 50 to 74 years. The increases in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) are primarily due to mammography screening, but DCIS still remains a relatively small proportion of the total breast cancer problem.;Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology,Breast Neoplasms/therapy*,Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating/diagnosis*,Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating/epidemiology,Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating/therapy*,Female,Humans,Incidence,Mammography/utilization*,Mass Screening/standards,Mass Screening/statistics & numerical data*,Middle Aged,Models, Theoretical*,Netherlands/epidemiology,Sensitivity and Specificity;16524452;

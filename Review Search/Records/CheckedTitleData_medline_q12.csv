"one",A modelling study to evaluate the costs and effects of lowering the starting age of population breast cancer screening.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Because the incidence of breast cancer increases between 45 and 50years of age, a reconsideration is required of the current starting age (typically 50years) for routine mammography. Our aim was to evaluate the quantitative benefits, harms, and cost-effectiveness of lowering the starting age of breast cancer screening in the Dutch general population. METHODS: Economic modelling with a lifelong perspective compared biennial screening for women aged 48-74years and for women aged 46-74years with the current Dutch screening programme, which screen women between the ages of 50 and 74years. Tumour deaths prevented, years of life saved (YOLS), false-positive rates, radiation-induced tumours, costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were evaluated. RESULTS: Starting the screening at 48 instead of 50 years of age led to increases in: the number of small tumours detected (4.0%), tumour deaths prevented (5.6%), false positives (9.2%), YOLS (5.6%), radiation-induced tumours (14.7%), and costs (4.1%). Starting the screening at 46 instead of 48 years of age increased the number of small tumours detected (3.3%), tumour deaths prevented (4.2%), false positives (8.8%), YOLS (3.7%), radiation-induced tumours (15.2%), and costs (4.0%). The ICER was �5600/YOLS for the 48-74 scenario and �5600/YOLS for the 46-74 scenario. CONCLUSIONS: Women could benefit from lowering the starting age of screening as more breast cancer deaths would be averted. Starting regular breast cancer screening earlier is also cost-effective. As the number of additional expected harms is relatively small in both the scenarios examined, and the difference in ICERs is not large, introducing two additional screening rounds is justifiable.

Methods: A Markov model for breast cancer was redeveloped based on true effect which was derived from a project for detection of women at high risk of breast cancer and an organized breast cancer screening program conducted simultaneously in Minhang district, Shanghai, during 2008 to 2012. Parameters of the model were derived from literatures. General principles related to cost-effectiveness analysis were used to compare the costs and effects of 12 different screening modalities in a simulated cohort involving 100 000 women aged 45 years. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was used to determine the most cost-effective modality. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate how these factors affected the estimated cost-effectiveness. Results: The modality of biennial CBE followed by ultrasonic and mammography among those with positive CBE was observed as the most cost-effective one. The costs appeared as 182 526 Yuan RMB per life year gained and 144 386 Yuan RMB per quality adjusted life-year (QALY) saved, which were within the threshold of 2-3 times of local per capita Gross Domestic Product. Results from sensitivity analysis showed that, due to higher incidence rate of breast cancer in Shanghai, the cost per QALY would be 64 836 Yuan RMB lower in Shanghai than the average level in China. Conclusion: Our research findings showed that the biennial CBE program followed by ultrasonic and mammography for those with positive CBE results might serve as the optimal breast cancer screening modality for Chinese women living in Shanghai, and thus be widely promoted in this population elsewhere.;Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi. 2017 Dec 10.38(12):1665-1671. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0254-6450.2017.12.017.;Wu F1, Mo M2, Qin XX3, Fang H4, Zhao GM5, Liu GY2, Chen YY3, Cao ZG2, Yan YJ4, Lyu LL2, Xu WH5, Shao ZM2.;29294584;Asian Continental Ancestry Group/statistics & numerical data*,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/economics,Breast Neoplasms/ethnology,Breast Neoplasms/prevention & control,China,Cost-Benefit Analysis*,Early Detection of Cancer/economics*,Female,Humans,Mammography/economics*,Markov Chains,Mass Screening/economics*,Mass Screening/methods,Models, Theoretical,Quality-Adjusted Life Years; Early Detection of Cancer, Combined Modality Therapy, Breast Neoplasms,Primary Prevention,Early Detection of Cancer;;model valid;0.8"not valid",The impact on women's health and the cervical cancer screening budget of primary HPV screening with dual-stain cytology triage in Belgium.;"Abstract Dual stain cytology, or ""diagnostic cytology"", offers a significant increase in sensitivity compared to cytology, with a slight decrease in specificity. This can reduce additional investigations like colposcopies, biopsies, and follow-up visits. Cervical cancer screening for women between 25 and 65 years of age with diagnostic cytology is estimated to reduce the incidence of cervical cancer by 36% and reduce annual cervical cancer mortalities by 40%. The reduced number of screening visits and the decrease in incidence and mortality will improve quality of life. In this article, a model was created to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of diagnostic cytology for Belgium. In this approach, precancerous cells are more likely to be immediately identified during the first screening visit. This reduces both the number and frequency of follow-up visits required. After two cycles (6 years), the prevalence of CIN and cervical cancer is decreased significantly in the screened population. At a population level, these shifts can reduce the screening budget by 21%, resulting in savings of 5.3 million euro a year in Belgium.

The program targeted prevention practices, including breast cancer screening, by offering a maximal amount of �245 for achieving a target screening rate among eligible women enrolled with the GP. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to evaluate the impact of the French P4P program (CAPI) on the early detection of breast cancer among women between 50 and 74 years old. METHODS: Based on an administrative database of 50,752 women aged 50-74 years followed between 2007 and 2011, we estimated a difference-in-difference model of breast cancer screening uptake as a function of visit to a CAPI signatory referral GP, while controlling for both supply-side and demand-side determinants (e.g., sociodemographics, health and healthcare use). RESULTS: Breast cancer screening rates have not changed significantly since the P4P program implementation. Overall, visiting a CAPI signatory referral GP at least once in the pre-CAPI period increased the probability of undergoing breast cancer screening by 1.38 % [95 % CI (0.41-2.35 %)], but the effect was not significantly different following the implementation of the contract. CONCLUSION: The French P4P program had a nonsignificant impact on breast cancer screening uptake. This result may reflect the fact that the low-powered incentives implemented in France through the CAPI might not provide sufficient leverage to generate better practices, thus inviting regulators to seek additional tools beyond P4P in the field of prevention and screening.;Eur J Health Econ. 2017 Jun.18(5):609-621. doi: 10.1007/s10198-016-0813-2.

Simulation modeling and other analyses have demonstrated that the NBCCEDP has significantly reduced breast and cervical cancer mortality among low-income uninsured and underinsured women in the USA, a major goal of the original legislation. The NBCCEDP has also served to build cancer prevention and control capacity in state and local health agencies and created strong and unique public-private partnerships aimed at improving women's health. As such, the impact of NBCCEDP extends beyond the millions of women served by the program to include increased public health system capacity and effectiveness regarding cancer early detection and control for all women.;Cancer Causes Control. 2015 May.26(5):653-6. doi: 10.1007/s10552-015-0565-9.

PURPOSE: To estimate the benefits in life-years (LYs) gained. quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. and deaths averted. METHODS: A cervical cancer simulation model was constructed based on an existing cohort model. The model was applied to NBCCEDP participants aged 18-64 years. Screening habits for uninsured low-income women were estimated using National Health Interview Survey data from 1990 to 2005 and NBCCEDP data from 1991 to 2007. The study was conducted during 2011-2012 and covered all 68 NBCCEDP grantees in 50 states, the District of Columbia, five U.S. territories, and 12 tribal organizations. Separate simulations were performed for the following three scenarios: (1) women who received NBCCEDP (Program) screening. (2) women who received screening without the program (No Program). and (3) women who received no screening (No Screening). RESULTS: Among 1.8 million women screened in 1991-2007, the Program added 10,369 LYs gained compared to No Program, and 101,509 LYs gained compared to No Screening. The Program prevented 325 women from dying of cervical cancer relative to No Program, and 3,829 relative to No Screening. During this time period, the Program accounted for 15,589 QALYs gained when compared with No Program, and 121,529 QALYs gained when compared with No Screening. CONCLUSIONS: These estimates suggest that NBCCEDP cervical cancer screening has reduced mortality among medically underserved low-income women who participated in the program.

OBJECTIVE: We examined utilization of the new AAA screening benefit and estimated how increased utilization could influence population health as measured by life years gained. Additionally, we explored the impact of expanding screening to women with smoking history. DESIGN: Analysis of Medicare claims and a simulation model to estimate the effects of screening, using published data for parameter estimates. SETTING: AAA screening in the primary care setting. PATIENTS: Newly-enrolled Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years, with smoking history or family history of AAA. MAIN MEASURES: Life expectancy, 10-year survival rates. KEY RESULTS: Medicare data revealed low utilization of AAA screening, under 1% among those eligible. We estimate that screening could increase life expectancy per individual invited to screening for men with smoking history (0.11 years), with family history of AAA (0.17 years), and women with family history (0.08 years), and smoking history (0.09 years). Average gains of 131 life years per 1,000 persons screened for AAA compare favorably with the grade B United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation for breast cancer screening, which yields 95-128 life years per 1,000 women screened. These findings were robust over a range of scenarios. LIMITATIONS: The simulation results reflect assumptions regarding AAA prevalence, treatment, and outcomes in specific populations based on published research and US survey data. Published data on women were limited. CONCLUSIONS: The Welcome to Medicare and AAA screening benefits have been underutilized. Increasing utilization of AAA screening would yield substantial gains in life expectancy. Expanding screening to women with smoking history also has the potential for substantial health benefits.;J Gen Intern Med. 2014 Aug.29(8):1155-61. doi: 10.1007/s11606-014-2831-z.

REVIEW METHODS: Two investigators screened each abstract and full-text article for inclusion. the investigators abstracted data, and they performed quality ratings, applicability ratings, and evidence grading. Random-effects models were used to compute summary estimates of effects. A simulation model was used to estimate the effects of OC use on the overall balance of benefits and harms. RESULTS: We reviewed 55 studies relevant to ovarian cancer outcomes, 66 relevant to other cancers, and 50 relevant to vascular events. Ovarian cancer incidence was significantly reduced in OC users (OR [odds ratio], 0.73. 95% CI [confidence interval], 0.66 to 0.81), with greater reductions seen with longer duration of use. Breast cancer incidence was slightly but significantly increased in OC users (OR, 1.08. 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.17), with a significant reduction in risk as time since last use increased. The risk of cervical cancer was significantly increased in women with persistent human papillomavirus infection who used OCs, but heterogeneity prevented a formal meta-analysis. Incidences of both colorectal cancer (OR, 0.86. 95% CI, 0.79 to 0.95) and endometrial cancer (OR, 0.57. 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.76) were significantly reduced by OC use. The risk of vascular events was increased in current OC users compared with nonusers, although the increase in myocardial infarction was not statistically significant. The overall strength of evidence for ovarian cancer prevention was moderate to low, primarily because of the lack of randomized trials and inconsistent reporting of important characteristics of use, such as duration. The simulation model predicted that the combined increase in risk of breast and cervical cancers and vascular events was likely to be equivalent to or greater than the decreased risk in ovarian cancer, although the harm/benefit ratio was much more favorable when protection against endometrial and colorectal cancers was added, resulting in net gains in life expectancy of approximately 1 month. CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of OCs solely for the primary prevention of ovarian cancer. Although the net effects of the current patterns of OC use likely result in increased life expectancy when other noncontraceptive benefits are included, the harm/benefit ratio for ovarian cancer prevention alone is uncertain, particularly when the potential quality-of-life impact of breast cancer and vascular events are considered.;Evid Rep Technol Assess (Full Rep). 2013 Jun.(212):1-514.;Havrilesky LJ, Gierisch JM, Moorman PG, Coeytaux RR, Urrutia RP, Lowery WJ, Dinan M, McBroom AJ, Wing L, Musty MD, Lallinger KR, Hasselblad V, Sanders GD, Myers ER.;24423062;Review,Contraceptives, Oral/administration & dosage*,Female,Humans,Ovarian Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Primary Prevention,Contraceptives, Oral;Breast Neoplasms,Primary Prevention,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms,Early Detection of Cancer;;model valid;0.26"not valid",Variation in tumor natural history contributes to racial disparities in breast cancer stage at diagnosis.;Abstract Black women tend to be diagnosed with breast cancer at a more advanced stage than whites and subsequently experience elevated breast cancer mortality. We sought to determine whether there are racial differences in tumor natural history that contribute to these disparities. We used the University of Wisconsin Breast Cancer Simulation Model, a validated member of the National Cancer Institute's Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network, to evaluate the contribution of racial differences in tumor natural history to observed disparities in breast cancer incidence. We fit eight natural history parameters in race-specific models by calibrating to the observed race- and stage-specific 1975-2000 U.S. incidence rates, while accounting for known racial variation in population structure, underlying risk of breast cancer, screening mammography utilization, and mortality from other causes. The best fit models indicated that a number of natural history parameters must vary between blacks and whites to reproduce the observed stage-specific incidence patterns. The mean of the tumor growth rate parameter was 63.6 % higher for blacks than whites (0.18, SE 0.04 vs. 0.11, SE 0.02). The fraction of tumors considered highly aggressive based on their tendency to metastasize at a small size was 2.2 times greater among blacks than whites (0.41, SE 0.009 vs. 0.019, SE 0.008). Based on our simulation model, breast tumors in blacks grow faster and are more likely to metastasize earlier than tumors in whites. These differences suggest that targeted prevention and detection strategies that go beyond equalizing access to mammography may be needed to eliminate breast cancer disparities.;Breast Cancer Res Treat. 2013 Apr.138(2):519-28. doi: 10.1007/s10549-013-2435-z.

Screening is not offered to younger or older participants, because the benefits in these age groups do not outweigh the harms. One could argue that it is not so much age that determines the benefits but the risk of developing preclinical and treatable cancer. Cancer risk varies with age but is also affected by other factors. METHODS: We performed a systematic review for risk models for the three types of cancer for which population screening programs exist: breast, cervical and colon cancer. We used an evaluation scheme that distinguishes three phases of model development: model derivation, validation and impact analysis. Data were collected in August 2010. RESULTS: We identified two colorectal, four breast and three cervix cancer risk models. One colorectal, four breast and none of the cervix cancer models have been externally validated. We could not identify evaluations of the impact on population screening effectiveness. CONCLUSION: We conclude that risk models for the pre-selection of screening have been developed. These models could improve the pre-selection for screening, help in making personal decisions about participation, and reduce adverse effects of population screening. The validity of this hypothesis, as well as practicalities and issues of equity and reliability, have to be tested in further studies. Copyright � 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Hence the number of screens for a given individual is a random variable as well. We use the actuarial life table from the Social Security Administration to obtain the lifetime distribution, and then use this information to project the lead time distribution for someone with a future screening schedule. Simulation studies using the HIP study group data provide estimates of the lead time under different screening frequencies. The projected lead time has two components: a point mass at zero (corresponding to interval cases detected between screening exams) and a continuous probability density. We present estimates of the projected lead time for participants in a breast cancer screening program. The model is more realistic and can inform optimal screening frequency.

The authors of this report optimized budgetary allocations by comparing cost-effectiveness data for different preventive and management strategies throughout the disease course for breast cancer in Hong Kong (HK) Chinese women. METHODS: Nesting a state-transition Markov model within a generalized cost-effectiveness analytic framework, costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were compared to estimate average cost-effectiveness ratios for the following interventions at the population level: biennial mass mammography (ages 40-69 years or ages 40-79 years), reduced waiting time for postoperative radiotherapy (by 15% or by 25%), adjuvant endocrine therapy (either upfront aromatase inhibitor [AI] therapy or sequentially with tamoxifen followed by AI) in postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive disease, targeted immunotherapy in those with tumors that over express human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, and enhanced palliative services (either at home or as an inpatient). Usual care for eligible patients in the public sector was the comparator. RESULTS: In descending order, the optimal allocation of additional resources for breast cancer would be the following: a 25% reduction in waiting time for postoperative radiotherapy (in US dollars: $5000 per QALY). enhanced, home-based palliative care ($7105 per QALY). adjuvant, sequential endocrine therapy ($17,963 per QALY). targeted immunotherapy ($62,092 per QALY). and mass mammography screening of women ages 40 to 69 years ($72,576 per QALY). CONCLUSIONS: Given the lower disease risk and different age profiles of patients in HK Chinese, among other newly emergent and emerging economies with similar transitioning epidemiologic profiles, the current findings provided direct evidence to support policy decisions that may be dissimilar to current Western practice.

The screening sensitivities, transition probabilities and sojourn time distributions are estimated for females aged 40-49 years and 50-59 years separately, using the Canadian National Breast Screening Study (CNBSS) data. The purpose is to estimate the lead time distribution and the probability of not detecting the cancer early. APPROACH: Within the 40-49-year-old and 50-59-year-old cohorts separately, the age-independent statistical model was applied. Bayesian estimators along with 95% highest probability density (HPD) credible intervals (CI) were calculated. Bayesian hypothesis testing was used to compare the parameter estimates of the two cohorts. The lead time density was also estimated for both the 40-49 and 50-59-year-old cohorts. RESULTS: The screening sensitivity, transition probability of the disease, and mean sojourn time were all found to increase with age. For the 40-49-year-old and 50-59-year-old cohorts, the posterior mean sensitivities were 0.70 (95% HPD-CI: 0.46, 0.93) and 0.77 (0.61, 0.93), respectively. The posterior mean transition probabilities were 0.0023 (0.0018, 0.0027) and 0.0031 (0.0024, 0.0038), while the posterior mean sojourn times were 2.55 (1.56, 4.26) years and 3.15 (2.12, 4.96) years. Bayes factors for the ratio of posterior probabilities that the respective parameter was larger vs. smaller in the 50-59-year-old cohort were estimated to be 2.09, 40.8 and 3.0 for the sensitivity, transition probability, and mean sojourn time, respectively. All three Bayes factors were larger than two, indicating greater than 2:1 odds in favor of the hypothesis that each of these parameters was greater in the 50-59-year-old cohort. The estimated mean lead times were 0.83 years and 0.96 years if the two cohorts were screened annually. CONCLUSIONS: The increase in sensitivity corresponds to an increase in the mean sojourn time. Breast cancer in younger women is more difficult to detect by screening tests and is more aggressive than breast cancer in older women. Women aged 50-59 tend to benefit more from screening compared with women aged 40-49.;Cancer Epidemiol. 2010 Aug.34(4):429-33. doi: 10.1016/j.canep.2010.04.001.;Chen Y1, Brock G, Wu D.;20434974;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Adult,Bayes Theorem,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology,Breast Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Canada/epidemiology,Early Detection of Cancer*,Female,Humans,Mammography*,Mass Screening*,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical*,Risk Factors,Survival Rate,P20 RR016481/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States,P30 ES014443/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States,R03 CA115012/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,R03 CA115012-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,R01 HD053509/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States,P20-RR/DE177702/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States,R03CA115012/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,P30-ES014443/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States,R01 DE018215/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States,P20RR16481/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States,R01-HD053509/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States,R01DE018215/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Breast Neoplasms;;model valid;0.248"one",Estimation of natural history parameters of breast cancer based on non-randomized organized screening data: subsidiary analysis of effects of inter-screening interval, sensitivity, and attendance rate on reduction of advanced cancer.;Abstract Estimating the natural history parameters of breast cancer not only elucidates the disease progression but also make contributions to assessing the impact of inter-screening interval, sensitivity, and attendance rate on reducing advanced breast cancer. We applied three-state and five-state Markov models to data on a two-yearly routine mammography screening in Finland between 1988 and 2000. The mean sojourn time (MST) was computed from estimated transition parameters. Computer simulation was implemented to examine the effect of inter-screening interval, sensitivity, and attendance rate on reducing advanced breast cancers. In three-state model, the MST was 2.02 years, and the sensitivity for detecting preclinical breast cancer was 84.83%. In five-state model, the MST was 2.21 years for localized tumor and 0.82 year for non-localized tumor. Annual, biennial, and triennial screening programs can reduce 53, 37, and 28% of advanced cancer. The effectiveness of intensive screening with poor attendance is the same as that of infrequent screening with high attendance rate. We demonstrated how to estimate the natural history parameters using a service screening program and applied these parameters to assess the impact of inter-screening interval, sensitivity, and attendance rate on reducing advanced cancer. The proposed method makes contribution to further cost-effectiveness analysis. However, these findings had better be validated by using a further long-term follow-up data.;Breast Cancer Res Treat. 2010 Jul.122(2):553-66. doi: 10.1007/s10549-009-0701-x.

This year's report includes trends in colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and death rates and highlights the use of microsimulation modeling as a tool for interpreting past trends and projecting future trends to assist in cancer control planning and policy decisions. METHODS: Information regarding invasive cancers was obtained from the NCI, CDC, and NAACCR. and information on deaths was obtained from the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics. Annual percentage changes in the age-standardized incidence and death rates (based on the year 2000 US population standard) for all cancers combined and for the top 15 cancers were estimated by joinpoint analysis of long-term trends (1975-2006) and for short-term fixed-interval trends (1997-2006). All statistical tests were 2-sided. RESULTS: Both incidence and death rates from all cancers combined significantly declined (P < .05) in the most recent time period for men and women overall and for most racial and ethnic populations. These decreases were driven largely by declines in both incidence and death rates for the 3 most common cancers in men (ie, lung and prostate cancers and CRC) and for 2 of the 3 leading cancers in women (ie, breast cancer and CRC). The long-term trends for lung cancer mortality in women had smaller and smaller increases until 2003, when there was a change to a nonsignificant decline. Microsimulation modeling demonstrates that declines in CRC death rates are consistent with a relatively large contribution from screening and with a smaller but demonstrable impact of risk factor reductions and improved treatments. These declines are projected to continue if risk factor modification, screening, and treatment remain at current rates, but they could be accelerated further with favorable trends in risk factors and higher utilization of screening and optimal treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Although the decrease in overall cancer incidence and death rates is encouraging, rising incidence and mortality for some cancers are of concern.

Under a prospective cohort design with exposed and non-exposed groups classified by whether women attended the screen upon invitation, we proposed a Bayesian acyclic graphic model for correcting self-selection bias with or without incorporation of prior information derived from previous studies with an identical screening program in Sweden by chronological order and applied it to an organized breast cancer service screening program in Pirkanmaa center of Finland. The relative mortality rate of breast cancer was 0.27 (95% CI 0.12-0.61) for the exposed group versus the non-exposed group without adjusting for self-selection bias. With adjustment for selection-bias, the adjusted relative mortality rate without using previous data was 0.76 (95% CI 0.49-1.15), whereas a statistically significant result was achieved [0.73 (95% CI 0.57-0.93)] with incorporation of previous information. With the incorporation of external data sources from Sweden in chronological order, adjusted relative mortality rate was 0.67 (0.55-0.80). We demonstrated how to apply a Bayesian acyclic graphic model with self-selection bias adjustment to evaluating an organized but non-randomized breast cancer screening program in a small geographic area with a significant 27% mortality reduction that is consistent with the previous result but more precise. Around 33% mortality was estimated by taking previous randomized controlled data from Sweden.;Breast Cancer Res Treat. 2010 Jun.121(3):671-8. doi: 10.1007/s10549-009-0604-x.

In addition, the historical exclusion of women from these disciplines has possibly skewed their development in directions that now need to be addressed. This paper focuses on three such factors: gendered libidos that privilege risk taking over prevention, fragmented forms of knowledge that encourage displaced forms of responsibility and group dynamics that discourage critique of accepted practices and limit the definition of one's group. The substantive safety of the practice and scientific contribution of radiologists might be considerably enhanced were the focus to switch from radiology to diagnosis. Such enlargement might redefine the brief of radiologists towards preventing as well as curing. evaluating some non-invasive and low-tech options, adopting some inclusive paradigms of clinical ecology and enlarging group identities to include those currently excluded through geography or social class from participating in the benefits of science.;Radiat Prot Dosimetry. 2009 Jul.135(2):109-14. doi: 10.1093/rpd/ncp055.

The density of family physicians in a given region is assumed to serve as proxy for the access to and availability of desirable primary care services. We use self-reported general and mental health status as our overall health outcome measures. We also use several quality of care indicators reflecting whether or not an individual received influenza immunization, mammography, pap smear, and colorectal cancer screening if at high-risk. The empirical results of this study suggest that an additional family physician per 10,000 population has a statistically significant impact in the order of 2% to 4% on self-reported general health status, as well as, other quality of care outcomes. We also find important socioeconomic and demographic factors, such as income, education and immigrant status, influencing health related outcomes considered in this study. Understanding the influence of physician density and socioeconomic factors on health related outcomes are important considerations for health policy and planning.;Cah Sociol Demogr Med. 2008 Jan-Mar.48(1):61-105.;Sarma S1, Peddigrew C.;18447066;Adolescent,Adult,Aged,Canada,Child,Colonic Neoplasms/prevention & control,Educational Status,Emigrants and Immigrants,Female,Health Services Accessibility/statistics & numerical data,Health Status,Humans,Immunization,Income,Influenza Vaccines,Male,Mammography,Mass Screening,Mental Health,Middle Aged,Outcome Assessment (Health Care)*,Papanicolaou Test,Physicians, Family/statistics & numerical data,Physicians, Family/supply & distribution*,Primary Health Care/statistics & numerical data,Quality of Health Care,Rectal Neoplasms/prevention & control,Socioeconomic Factors,Vaginal Smears,Influenza Vaccines;Breast Neoplasms,Primary Prevention,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms,Early Detection of Cancer;;model valid;0.208"not valid",Bayesian inference for the lead time in periodic cancer screening.;Abstract This article develops a probability distribution for the lead time in periodic cancer screening examinations. The general aim is to allow statistical inference for a screening program's lead time, the length of time the diagnosis is advanced by screening. The program's lead time is distributed as a mixture of a point mass and a piecewise continuous distribution. Simulation studies using the HIP (Health Insurance Plan for Greater New York) study's data provide estimates of different characteristics of a screening program under different screening frequencies. The components of this mixture represent two aspects of screening's benefit, namely, a reduction in the number of interval cases and the extent by which screening advanced the age of diagnosis. We present estimates of these two measures for participants in a breast cancer screening program. We also provide the mean, mode, variance, and density curve of the program's lead time. The model can provide policy makers with important information regarding the screening period, frequency, and the endpoints that may serve as surrogates for the benefit to women who take part in a periodic screening program. Though the study focuses on breast cancer screening, it is also applicable to other kinds of chronic disease.;Biometrics. 2007 Sep.63(3):873-80.;Wu D1, Rosner GL, Broemeling LD.;17825017;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Bayes Theorem,Biometry/methods,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Breast Neoplasms/prevention & control,Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted/methods,Female,Humans,Mass Screening/methods*,Population Surveillance/methods*,Reproducibility of Results,Risk Assessment/methods*,Risk Factors,Sensitivity and Specificity,Time Factors,CA-115012/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,R03 CA115012/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,R03 CA115012-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,CA-093459/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,P50 CA093459/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,R03 CA115012-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Breast Neoplasms;;model valid;0.32"valid",Evolution of multiple disease screening in Keelung: a model for community involvement in health interventions?;Abstract OBJECTIVE: Screening for cancer and other chronic conditions tends to be conducted in independent programmes. that is, screening for one disease at a time. The Keelung community-based multiple disease screening programme, developed in Keelung city, Taiwan, is a notable exception. Here, we report on the Keelung programme's ethos and development within the community, focusing on equity of delivery of the service, and community involvement. In addition, we present some preliminary cost-effectiveness analyses of multiple disease screening. METHODS: The Keelung programme offers screening for breast, colorectal and liver cancers, cervical and oral neoplasia, all of which have an evidence base for their efficacy, and for diabetes, hypertension, osteoporosis and hyperlipidaemia, which are of unknown efficacy. We assessed variability of coverage rates of the Keelung Community-based Integrated Screening (KCIS) programme with age and socioeconomic status, availability of facilities for referral of positive screenees, and numbers of community social workers, general practitioners and local hospitals involved in the programme. We also assessed in qualitative terms how the programme interacts with non-health agencies. Finally, we simulated activities and costs for a variety of single- and multiple-disease screening situations. RESULTS: Between 1999 and 2003, coverage increased overall from 14.7 to 34.4%, and increased most dramatically in people aged 60-79 years (from around 30 to 60%) and in those of lower educational status (from around 40 to 70%). There was a significant growth in the involvement of social workers and volunteers in the programme, and an increase in the availability of local diagnostic and care facilities for those screened positive. In addition, there was substantial involvement of non-health agencies in publicizing the programme. In the health economic simulations, compared with no screening, the extra costs to gain an additional life year were estimated as 667 US dollars, 608 US dollars, 4227 and 4789 US dollars for multiple screening with 100% attendance, multiple screening with 70% attendance, single disease screening with 100% attendance and single disease screening with 30% attendance at each programme (i.e. 74% attendance for at least one out of four programmes), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The innovative design and outreach procedures of the KCIS have led to a growth in delivery of screening services to groups sometimes overlooked (equity), community involvement in health care (participation) and the use of non-health organizations for publicity and health education (collaboration). Simulation studies indicate that multiple disease screening may be more cost-effective than single disease screening.;J Med Screen. 2006.13 Suppl 1:S54-8.;Wang PE1, Wang TT, Chiu YH, Yen AM, Chen TH.;17227644;Adult,Aged,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis,Breast Neoplasms/prevention & control,Community Health Services/standards,Community Health Services/statistics & numerical data,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Female,Humans,Liver Neoplasms/diagnosis,Liver Neoplasms/prevention & control,Male,Mass Screening/economics,Mass Screening/methods*,Mass Screening/statistics & numerical data,Middle Aged,Mouth Neoplasms/diagnosis,Mouth Neoplasms/prevention & control,Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Neoplasms/prevention & control,Social Class,Taiwan,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control;Breast Neoplasms,Primary Prevention,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms,Early Detection of Cancer;;model valid;0.504"not valid",Determinants of the demand for breast cancer screening among women veterans in the United States.;Abstract Demand theory has been applied to use of breast exams for cancer prevention, but not since widespread promotion of mammography screening and managed care. Previous economic analyses may be biased due to inclusion of diagnostic exams and generally fail to consider perceived risk and time costs. The objective was to identify and measure the effect of economic, demographic, and behavioral factors that influence the use of mammography screening among US women veterans aged 50 years and older. Data are from a 2000-2001 national mail survey with telephone follow-up of a random sample of women veterans. There were a maximum of 3415 respondents aged 50 and over with no history of breast cancer. Maximum likelihood probit models were used to estimate the effects of the independent variables on the probability that a woman will have had a mammogram in the past year. Education, income, insurance, and perceived risk of breast cancer are directly related to use of mammography screening. Age, smoking, travel and waiting time are inversely related to the likelihood of mammography screening. Mammography use among women veterans is generally consistent with the theory of the demand for health and medical care, and also consistent with previous national studies on the demand for breast exams. Findings highlight the role of perceived risk and non-price barriers to mammography use in the context of widespread insurance coverage for mammography screening.;Soc Sci Med. 2005 Oct.61(7):1608-17.

Costs, benefits, and harms of breast cancer screening by age, biology, and health status.;Abstract CONTEXT: Optimal ages of breast cancer screening cessation remain uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate screening policies based on age and quartiles of life expectancy (LE). DESIGN AND POPULATION: We used a stochastic model with proxies of age-dependent biology to evaluate the incremental U.S. societal costs and benefits of biennial screening from age 50 until age 70, 79, or lifetime. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Discounted incremental costs per life years saved (LYS). RESULTS: Lifetime screening is expensive (151,434 dollars per LYS) if women have treatment and survival comparable to clinical trials (idealized). stopping at age 79 costs 82,063 dollars per LYS. This latter result corresponds to costs associated with an LE of 9.5 years at age 79, a value expected for 75% of 79-year-olds, about 50% of 80-year-olds, and 25% of 85-year-olds. Using actual treatment and survival patterns, screening benefits are greater, and lifetime screening of all women might be considered (114,905 dollars per LYS), especially for women in the top 25% of LE for their age (50,643 dollars per LYS, life expectancy of approximately 7 years at age 90). CONCLUSIONS: If all women receive idealized treatment, the benefits of mammography beyond age 79 are too low relative to their costs to justify continued screening. However, if treatment is not ideal, extending screening beyond age 79 could be considered, especially for women in the top 25% of life expectancy for their age.;J Gen Intern Med. 2005 Jun.20(6):487-96.;Mandelblatt JS1, Schechter CB, Yabroff KR, Lawrence W, Dignam J, Extermann M, Fox S, Orosz G, Silliman R, Cullen J, Balducci L.

METHODS: A Markov model was developed to compare risk management strategies for high-risk women considering chemoprevention. Annual screening is compared to the use of chemoprevention for all women and the use of risk assessment technologies to stratify patients for chemoprevention. The biomarker atypia was used to stratify women by risk. Random fine-needle aspiration (rFNA) and ductal lavage (DL) were evaluated and compared as the risk assessment tools used to discover atypia. Sensitivity analyses explore assumptions regarding the prognostic and predictive characteristics of atypia, both the relative breast cancer risk and benefit from chemoprevention women with atypia incur. RESULTS: Risk assessment strategies using rFNA or DL in combination with chemoprevention are found to be cost-effective (<$50,000 per life year saved) in high-risk groups under most scenarios. Both strategies were more effective and less costly in younger cohorts. Effectiveness of the risk assessment strategies increased when higher risk and increased benefit from chemoprevention were associated with atypia. Within the scenarios tested, rFNA is less costly than DL. CONCLUSION: rFNA and DL appear to be cost-effective in high-risk women, assuming women with detected atypia choose tamoxifen. The tools are largely effective for women who are not motivated to take tamoxifen but would be if atypia were found. As biomarker risk assessment tools better predict the risk of breast cancer and or benefit of interventions, their cost-effectiveness increases.;Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2004 Dec.13(12):2043-52.;Ozanne EM1, Esserman LJ.;15598759;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Aged,Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/therapeutic use,Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis*,Biopsy, Needle,Breast Neoplasms/economics*,Breast Neoplasms/etiology*,Breast Neoplasms/prevention & control,Chemoprevention,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Decision Making,Female,Humans,Markov Chains,Middle Aged,Prognosis,Risk Assessment,Sensitivity and Specificity,Survival,Tamoxifen/therapeutic use,Therapeutic Irrigation,Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal,Biomarkers, Tumor,Tamoxifen;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Breast Neoplasms;;model valid;0.548"not valid",Sensitivity analysis for healthcare models fitted to data by statistical methods.;"Abstract After fitting complex models to data using statistical methods, a sensitivity analysis can be carried out. This determines which parts of a model are causing the bulk of the uncertainty in the model predictions (model ""output""), and is a decision-support tool for the modeller who contemplates refining a model further or collecting additional data. A simple methodology for carrying out a sensitivity analysis is described. It is envisaged that such a relatively quick insight-generating step would precede the use of a more formal decision-theoretic approach that would address specific questions. Its use is illustrated using a model for breast cancer screening previously published in this journal.

This study's objectives were to determine the effect of ESRD on life expectancy for a cohort of 20-yr-olds and to compare this impact to that of several cancers for which population-based screening programs exist. A computer simulation, stratified by race (white, black) and by gender was used to calculate cumulative lifetime risk of ESRD, life-years lost to ESRD, and cumulative Medicare payments for ESRD. Similar calculations were made for breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer. The cumulative lifetime risk of ESRD for a 20-yr-old black woman is 7.8%. Equivalent risks for black men are 7.3%, white men 2.5%, and white women 1.8%. Lost years of life attributable to ESRD are 1.09, 1.10, 0.40, and 0.32 yr for black women, black men, white men, and white women, respectively. In blacks, ESRD is responsible for nearly as much loss of life-years as breast cancer in women and more loss of life-years than colorectal or prostate cancer in men. In addition, treatment costs for ESRD in this population are many-fold more expensive than cumulative treatment costs of these cancers. Exploring new screening and treatment strategies may be warranted to prevent ESRD, particularly in the US black population.;J Am Soc Nephrol. 2002 Jun.13(6):1635-44.;Kiberd BA1, Clase CM.;12039993;Adult,African Continental Ancestry Group,Aged,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology,Breast Neoplasms/mortality,Colorectal Neoplasms/epidemiology,Colorectal Neoplasms/mortality,Computer Simulation,European Continental Ancestry Group,Female,Humans,Kidney Failure, Chronic/epidemiology*,Kidney Failure, Chronic/mortality,Kidney Failure, Chronic/prevention & control,Life Expectancy,Male,Middle Aged,Prostatic Neoplasms/epidemiology,Prostatic Neoplasms/mortality,Risk,United States/epidemiology;Breast Neoplasms,Primary Prevention,Prostatic Neoplasms,Early Detection of Cancer;;model valid;0.284"one",Cost-effectiveness of screening the average-risk population for colorectal cancer.;Abstract This article reviews several of the recent models addressing the cost-effectiveness of colorectal cancer screening in the average-risk individual (Table 1). How can clinicians and policy makers use this information for decision making regarding colorectal cancer screening? The cost-effectiveness ratios reported by themselves do not identify cost-effective practices. They must be placed in a decision context that is expressed in one of two forms. In the first form, an explicit threshold or maximum amount that a policy maker is willing to spend is stated (e.g., $40,000 per LY gained, as has been quoted as an acceptable amount for a prevention program). In the second form of decision context, a list of medical practices and their associated cost-effectiveness ratios, also known as a league table (Table 2) is used as a basis for comparison with the practice under evaluation (e.g., colorectal cancer screening). The practice with the lowest cost-effectiveness ratio is the most cost-effective practice on the list. Practices with lower cost-effectiveness ratios are considered cost-effective compared with those with higher ratios. Table 2 lists incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for common medical practices. The models discussed in this article suggested that colorectal cancer screening using annual FOBT, flexible sigmoidoscopy at 3 or 5 years, the combination of FOBT and flexible sigmoidoscopy, barium enema, colonoscopy, and even virtual colonoscopy had incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranging from $6300 to $92,900 per LY saved with most of the cost-effectiveness ratio ranging from $10,000 to $40,000 per LY saved. These ratios are similar to the cost of another widely accepted practice, breast cancer screening with annual mammography in women age 50 and older ($22,000 per LY gained). Colorectal cancer screening with any of the modalities discussed is considered less cost-effective than screening for hemochromatosis, which has an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $3665 per LY saved. Based on these ratios, however, screening for colorectal cancer is considered cost-effective compared with cervical cancer screening in women age 20 and older with pap smear every 3 years, which has an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $250,000 per LY gained. The clinician can use these incremental cost-effectiveness ratios to evaluate the risks and benefits of alternative practices for the individual, and the policy maker with a limited health care budget can use these ratios to set priorities for funding based on the costs and the expected gains in life expectancy for colorectal cancer screening and for alternative health care programs.;Gastrointest Endosc Clin N Am. 2002 Jan.12(1):93-109.;Provenzale D1.;11916165;Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.,Colonoscopy/economics*,Colorectal Neoplasms/economics*,Colorectal Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Humans,Life Expectancy,Mass Screening/economics*,Models, Economic,Sigmoidoscopy/economics,United States,Value of Life,1 K24 CA83885-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;Breast Neoplasms,Primary Prevention,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms,Early Detection of Cancer;;model valid;0.68"not valid",[Estimating cost functions of cancer screening programs provided by municipalities].;Abstract OBJECTIVE: To estimate cost functions of cancer screening programs for stomach, lung, colorectal, cervical, and breast cancers provided by municipalities and to describe the relationship between the costs and the scale of cancer screening programs. METHODS: Subjects were all the municipalities in Japan. Questionnaires were sent to 3,182 subjects and 1,860 responses were received. Data obtained from questionnaires were the number of persons screened and the total cost of each program in the 1998 fiscal year. A cost function of each program was specified as a linear model, a power model, and a cubic model, and the fitness of each model was estimated. RESULTS: Long-run cost functions of all the cancer screening programs allowed better explanation of the relationship between the number of persons screened and the total cost than short-run cost functions. The average costs of stomach, colorectal, and cervical cancer screening programs increased and the average cost of the lung cancer screening program decreased, as the number of persons screened increased. The cost function of the breast cancer screening program could not be identified. CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary to estimate not only cost functions but also production functions of cancer screening programs using the data related to products, costs, and factors of production to evaluate the efficiency of cancer screening programs.;Nihon Koshu Eisei Zasshi. 2000 Dec.47(12):1004-12.;Takemura S1, Ohida T, Sone T, Ishii T, Fukuda T, Nakahara T, Kondo T.;11201142;English Abstract,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Cities/economics*,Health Care Costs*,Humans,Mass Screening/economics*,Models, Economic,Neoplasms/prevention & control*;Early Detection of Cancer,Breast Neoplasms,Primary Prevention,Lung Neoplasms,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.348"not valid",What is the potential cost-effectiveness of enforcing a prohibition on the sale of tobacco to minors?;Abstract BACKGROUND: Enforcement programs to halt the sale of tobacco to youths have been implemented across the United States. The potential cost-effectiveness of enforcement was evaluated under a range of assumptions regarding cost and impact. METHODS: An enforcement model was constructed incorporating quarterly inspections of all tobacco vendors. The cost of discounted years of life saved was calculated using reported values regarding cost and a range of assumptions regarding the impact on youth tobacco use. RESULTS: Inspecting an estimated 543,000 tobacco outlets would cost up to $190 million annually. Costs range from $44 to $8,200 per year of life saved depending on the discount rate and assumptions regarding cost, and efficacy. To compete in cost-effectiveness with implementing smoking cessation guidelines, enforcement would have to produce a 5% reduction in adolescent smoking at a cost of no more than $250 per vendor. CONCLUSION: At this level of cost and effectiveness an enforcement program could save 10 times as many lives as the same amount spent on mammography or screening for colorectal carcinoma. A one-cent per pack cigarette tax could fully fund enforcement. Enforcement of tobacco sales laws deserves further study as one component of a multifaceted approach to tobacco use prevention.

Specifically, they looked at the impact on the odds ratio of the way in which exposure to screening is defined, the type of age matching, the time scale used, and the criteria used to determine control eligibility. The results showed that defining exposure as ""ever/never"" screened produced, as expected, a serious bias in favor of screening. Defining exposure as being screened no later than the time the case's cancer is diagnosed has a serious bias against screening. An alternative exposure definition--screening can occur no later than the time the case would have been clinically diagnosed--eliminates the bias against screening. Further, the results showed that the type of age matching and the time scale used can produce a bias against screening and that this bias can be quite strong when case-control studies are performed in populations with a periodic screening program that is the only source of screening. Finally, control eligibility criteria had little effect.";Am J Epidemiol. 2000 May 15.151(10):991-8.;Connor RJ1, Boer R, Prorok PC, Weed DL.;10853638;Age Distribution,Aged,Bias*,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/etiology,Breast Neoplasms/mortality*,Case-Control Studies*,Computer Simulation*,Data Interpretation, Statistical,Environmental Exposure/adverse effects,Environmental Exposure/analysis,Epidemiologic Research Design*,Female,Humans,Mass Screening/standards*,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical*,Odds Ratio,Reproducibility of Results,Survival Analysis,Time Factors;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Breast Neoplasms;;model valid;0.24"one",Continuing screening mammography in women aged 70 to 79 years: impact on life expectancy and cost-effectiveness.;Abstract CONTEXT: Mammography is recommended and is cost-effective for women aged 50 to 69 years, but the value of continuing screening mammography after age 69 years is not known. In particular, older women with low bone mineral density (BMD) have a lower risk of breast cancer and may benefit less from continued screening. OBJECTIVE: To compare life expectancy and cost-effectiveness of screening mammography in elderly women based on 3 screening strategies. DESIGN: Decision analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov model. PATIENTS: General population of women aged 65 years or older. INTERVENTIONS: The analysis compared 3 strategies: (1) Undergoing biennial mammography from age 65 to 69 years. (2) undergoing biennial mammography from age 65 to 69 years, measurement of distal radial BMD at age 65 years, discontinuing screening at age 69 years in women in the lowest BMD quartile for age, and continuing biennial mammography to age 79 years in those in the top 3 quartiles of distal radius BMD. and (3) undergoing biennial mammography from age 65 to 79 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Deaths due to breast cancer averted, life expectancy, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: Compared with discontinuing mammography screening at age 69 years, measuring BMD at age 65 years in 10000 women and continuing mammography to age 79 years only in women with BMD in the top 3 quartiles would prevent 9.4 deaths and add, on average, 2.1 days to life expectancy at an incremental cost of $66773 per year of life saved. Continuing mammography to age 79 years in all 10000 elderly women would prevent 1.4 additional breast cancer deaths and add only 7.2 hours to life expectancy at an incremental cost of $117689 per year of life saved compared with only continuing mammography to age 79 years in women with BMD in the top 3 quartiles. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis suggests that continuing mammography screening after age 69 years results in a small gain in life expectancy and is moderately cost-effective in those with high BMD and more costly in those with low BMD. Women's preferences for a small gain in life expectancy and the potential harms of screening mammography should play an important role when elderly women are deciding about screening.;JAMA. 1999 Dec 8.282(22):2156-63.;Kerlikowske K1, Salzmann P, Phillips KA, Cauley JA, Cummings SR.;10591338;Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Bone Density,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology,Breast Neoplasms/prevention & control,Carcinoma in Situ/epidemiology,Carcinoma in Situ/prevention & control,Carcinoma, Ductal, Breast/epidemiology,Carcinoma, Ductal, Breast/prevention & control,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Decision Support Techniques,Female,Humans,Life Expectancy*,Mammography/economics*,Mammography/statistics & numerical data*,Markov Chains,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,Sensitivity and Specificity,1 U01 CA 63740/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,P50 CA58207/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Breast Neoplasms;;model valid;0.688"one",Breast cancer: computer simulation method for estimating optimal intervals for screening.;Abstract PURPOSE: To develop and evaluate a mathematic method that can be used to determine the optimal screening interval for detection of breast cancer prior to distant metastatic spread. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A computer simulation was developed with the use of biologically based data from the literature on the rates of tumor growth and spread, which can be used to calculate the course of breast cancer growth and metastasis. RESULTS: On the basis of the data available at this time, the results of the simulations suggested that a screening interval of 2 years would result in a 22% reduction in the rate of distant metastatic disease, an interval of 1 year would result in a 51% reduction, and an interval of 6 months would result in an 80% reduction.

There are four options of interest depending on: whether the women are assessed on the mainland or at outreach assessment clinics. and whether all women have two view screening rather than only those being screened for the first time. The benefits of outreach assessment are assumed to be solely in terms of convenience to women and reductions in the time and travel costs of women recalled for assessment. The costs are modelled in order to compare outreach and no outreach options. The results show that for the numbers of women currently screened outreach assessment is the cost-minimizing strategy. The model provides useful guidance with respect to screening policy and is readily applied to the case of outreach assessment in mainland communities outwith major population centres and to breast and other screening programmes in other countries.;Int J Health Plann Manage. 1999 Jan-Mar.14(1):57-67.;van der Pol MM1, Cairns JA, Gilbert FJ, Hendry PJ.;10351680;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/prevention & control,Community Health Services/economics*,Community Health Services/organization & administration,Community-Institutional Relations,Data Collection,Female,Health Care Costs/statistics & numerical data,Health Services Research,Humans,Mammography/economics*,Mammography/utilization,Mass Screening/economics*,Models, Economic,Scotland;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Breast Neoplasms;;model valid;0.46"not valid",NHS breast screening programme.

For the analysis of data from a nonrandomized study, we assume (i) once breast cancer can be detected on screening and confirmed by biopsy, it will stay that way. (ii) given age, the probability of breast cancer detection does not depend on year of birth. and (iii) subjects who refuse screening have the same rates of breast cancer mortality following diagnosis as screened subjects had they not received screening. The key idea is that older screened subjects are controls for younger screened subjects. For the analysis of data from a randomized study, we relax assumption (iii). Based on the HIP randomized trial and assumptions (i) and (ii), we estimate that starting periodic breast cancer screening with mammography and physical examination at age 40 instead of age 50 reduces breast cancer mortality by 14 per 10,000 with a 95% confidence interval of (-4/10,000, 32/10,000). This must be weighted against an estimated increase in the number of biopsies that do not detect cancer of 580 per 10,000 with a 95% confidence interval of (520/10,000, 650/10,000).;Biometrics. 1998 Dec.54(4):1569-78.;Baker SG1.;9883553;Adult,Age Factors,Biometry/methods*,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Breast Neoplasms/mortality,Female,Humans,Mass Screening/methods,Mass Screening/statistics & numerical data*,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical,Random Allocation;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Breast Neoplasms;;model valid;0.224"one",Evaluation by Markov chain models of a non-randomised breast cancer screening programme in women aged under 50 years in Sweden.;Abstract STUDY OBJECTIVE: To apply Markov chain models that have previously been used on data in randomised trials of breast cancer screening to data from an uncontrolled service screening programme. to compare results with those from a randomised trial. DESIGN: A service screening programme in Uppsala county, Sweden, inviting 25,660 women aged 39-49 to mammographic screening every 20 months, and the Swedish Two-County Trial inviting 19,844 women aged 40-49 to two yearly screening, compared with 15,604 women of the same age in an unscreened control group. Data were analysed using Markov chain models and quasi-likelihood estimation procedures. MAIN RESULTS: The results with respect to parameters of disease progression were very similar between the two studies. Use of estimated progression rates to predict the effect on mortality ranged from a 10% to a 17% reduction in breast cancer mortality in the Two-County Study and predicted a 15% reduction in the Uppsala programme. These compare well with the observed mortality reduction of 13% in the Two-County Trial. CONCLUSIONS: The screening in the Uppsala programme is likely to have a similar effect to that observed in the Two-County Trial.

DESIGN: Computer simulation model which first simulates life histories for women in the absence of a screening programme for breast cancer and then assesses how these life histories would be changed by introducing different screening policies. The model was informed by screening and cost data from the NHS breast screening programme. SETTING: North West region of England. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Numbers of deaths prevented, life years gained, and costs. RESULTS: Compared with the current breast screening programme both modifications would increase the number of deaths prevented and the number of life years saved. The current screening policy costs 2522 pounds per life year gained. extending the age range of the programme would cost 2612 pounds and shortening the interval 2709 pounds per life year gained. The marginal cost per life year gained of extending the age range of the screening programme is 2990 pounds and of shortening the screening interval is 3545 pounds. CONCLUSIONS: If the budget for the NHS breast screening programme were to allow for two more invitations per woman, substantial mortality reductions would follow from extending the age range screened or reducing the screening interval. The difference between the two policies is so small that either could be chosen.;BMJ. 1998 Aug 8.317(7155):376-9.;Boer R1, de Koning H, Threlfall A, Warmerdam P, Street A, Friedman E, Woodman C.;9694752;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Age Factors,Aged,Breast Neoplasms/economics*,Breast Neoplasms/prevention & control,Computer Simulation,Cost of Illness,Cost-Benefit Analysis,England,Female,Health Policy/economics,Humans,Life Expectancy,Mass Screening/economics*,Middle Aged,State Medicine/economics,Time Factors,Value of Life;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Breast Neoplasms;;model valid;0.708"one",Faecal occult blood screening for colorectal cancer: is it cost-effective?;Abstract Recently published evidence from two large-scale clinical trials conducted in England and in Denmark suggests that faecal occult blood screening for colorectal cancer significantly reduces mortality. However, before screening can be advocated as part of national health policy, its cost-effectiveness must be demonstrated. The English screening trial has been the subject of a detailed economic evaluation over the past 10 years In this paper, cost-effectiveness estimates of screening are presented, based on cost and outcome data combined in a mathematical model developed from the trial's clinical findings The estimates of cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained from colorectal cancer screening show the procedure to be of similar cost-effectiveness to breast cancer screening in the short term.

Observed results in Navarra, consisting of more than 100,000 screens, were compared with expected results. A microsimulation screening analysis model was used that included demographical, epidemiological and screening characteristics of Navarra. Alternative assumptions on epidemiological and screening characteristics were also addressed. The observed detection rate (5.9 per 1,000 screened women) in the first round was 18% higher than expected. the observed rate in the subsequent round (2.9) was 17% lower than expected. Longer pre-clinical durations, lower sensitivity or the existence of a high-risk group in Navarra could not satisfactorily explain the first and second round results together. Nevertheless, the programme will have an important health benefit for the women involved, due to an important trend in incidence in recent years and the relatively unfavourable clinical stage distribution in Navarra. The proportion T2+ cancers that will be prevented after 10 years of screening amounts to 36%. The annual mortality reduction in steady state is expected to range between 17% (if the observed rates in the second round indicate real screening performance) to 23% (if the first round indicates real performance). Our results demonstrate that a high detection rate in the first round is insufficient to evaluate the quality of a programme. Interval cancer rates, results of the subsequent round and size distributions are also crucial indicators of the quality of the screening programme and should be analysed in their specific context.;Int J Cancer. 1997 Nov 14.73(4):464-9.;van den Akker-van Marle ME1, Reep-van den Bergh CM, Boer R, Del Moral A, Ascunce N, de Koning HJ.;9389557;Age Distribution,Aged,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Breast Neoplasms/pathology,Breast Neoplasms/prevention & control,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Female,Humans,Middle Aged,Neoplasm Staging,Pilot Projects,Prevalence,Program Evaluation,Spain/epidemiology;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Breast Neoplasms;;model valid;0.488"one",Quantitative estimates of the impact of sensitivity and specificity in mammographic screening in Germany.;"Abstract STUDY OBJECTIVE: To estimate quantitatively the impact of the quality of mammographic screening (in terms of sensitivity and specificity) on the effects and costs of nationwide breast cancer screening. DESIGN: Three plausible ""quality"" scenarios for a biennial breast cancer screening programme for women aged 50-69 in Germany were analysed in terms of costs and effects using the Microsimulation Screening Analysis model on breast cancer screening and the natural history of breast cancer. Firstly, sensitivity and specificity in the expected situation (or ""baseline"" scenario) were estimated from a model based analysis of empirical data from 35,000 screening examinations in two German pilot projects. In the second ""high quality"" scenario, these properties were based on the more favourable diagnostic results from breast cancer screening projects and the nationwide programme in The Netherlands. Thirdly, a worst case, ""low quality"" hypothetical scenario with a 25% lower sensitivity than that experienced in The Netherlands was analysed. SETTING: The epidemiological and social situation in Germany in relation to mass screening for breast cancer. RESULTS: In the ""baseline"" scenario, an 11% reduction in breast cancer mortality was expected in the total German female population, ie 2100 breast cancer deaths would be prevented per year. It was estimated that the ""high quality"" scenario, based on Dutch experience, would lead to the prevention of an additional 200 deaths per year and would also cut the number of false positive biopsy results by half. The cost per life year gained varied from Deutsche mark (DM) 15,000 on the ""high quality"" scenario to DM 21,000 in the ""low quality"" setting.

This paper describes a model for simultaneously estimating the mean lead time and the sensitivity when only the number of cancers detected at the successive screenings and the number of cancers occurring in the time interval between the screening examinations are known. This model is particularly useful in assessing the effect of screening when the underlying cancer incidence in the screened group is unknown. The model is fitted to the data of 235 screen-detected breast cancer cases and 146 interval cancers diagnosed across 6 screening rounds of the program in Nijmegen. The maximum likelihood estimate for the mean lead time ranges from 1.3 years in the under age 50 group to 2.2 years in the age 50-65 group, both estimates having large confidence intervals.

We performed a meta-analysis of published randomized controlled trials to assess the overall effectiveness of computer-based reminder systems in ambulatory settings directed at preventive care. DESIGN: Meta-analysis. SEARCH STRATEGY: Searches of the Medline (1966-1994), Nursing and Allied Health (1982-1994), and Health Planning and Administration (1975-1994) databases identified 16 randomized, controlled trials of computer-based reminder systems in ambulatory settings. STATISTICAL METHODS: A weighted mixed effects model regression analysis was used to estimate intervention effects for computer and manual reminder systems for six classes of preventive practices. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Adjusted odds ratio for preventive practices. RESULTS: Computer reminders improved preventive practices compared with the control condition for vaccinations (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 3.09. 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.39-4.00), breast cancer screening (OR 1.88. 95% CI 1.44-2.45), colorectal cancer screening (OR 2.25. 95% CI 1.74-2.91), and cardiovascular risk reduction (OR 2.01. 95% CI 1.55-2.61) but not cervical cancer screening (OR 1.15. 95% CI 0.89-1.49) or other preventive care (OR 1.02. 95% CI 0.79-1.32).

DESIGN: A computer assisted simulation of an AAA screening programme. The simulation incorporated assumptions gleaned from the literature about the epidemiology of AAA and the costs of screening. In addition, up-to-date costings based on recent Manchester (U.K.) vascular surgery experience are used. SETTING: A dialogue between National Health Service commissioners and providers to explore the feasibility and desirability of introducing AAA screening. CHIEF OUTCOME MEASURE: Cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained. MAIN RESULTS: The absolute cost (circa 1992/3) per QALY gained from screening for and treating aneurysms of > or = 6 cm in diameter of pounds 1500 (benefit not discounted). Offsetting current treatment costs of ruptured aneurysms gives a net additional cost per QALY of pounds 1300. Screening and treating aneurysms of > or = 5 cm leads to a cost per QALY gained exceeding pounds 20000. The findings are robust under sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Routine screening for AAAs of size > or = 6 cm compares favourably in terms of cost per QALY gained with services such as breast and cervical cancer screening.;Eur J Vasc Endovasc Surg. 1996 Feb.11(2):183-90.;St Leger AS1, Spencely M, McCollum CN, Mossa M.;8616650;Aged,Aortic Aneurysm, Abdominal/economics*,Aortic Aneurysm, Abdominal/mortality,Aortic Aneurysm, Abdominal/prevention & control,Computer Simulation*,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Data Interpretation, Statistical,Hospital Costs/statistics & numerical data,Humans,Male,Mass Screening/economics*,Mass Screening/statistics & numerical data,Models, Economic*,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,Risk Factors,Sensitivity and Specificity,United Kingdom/epidemiology;Early Detection of Cancer,Breast Neoplasms,Combined Modality Therapy,Primary Prevention,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.616"one",Reliability of underlying incidence rates for estimating the effect and efficiency of screening for breast cancer.;Abstract The process of setting screening performance targets requires an estimate of what the incidence of breast cancer would have been in the population invited for screening if there had not been a screening programme. Before the introduction of the National Health Service breast screening programme in 1988 the incidence of breast cancer was already increasing in the population targeted for screening. To establish the incidence before screening the most recent complete data from all the regional cancer registries were collated. An age-period model was constructed to predict what these incidence rates might now have been if the screening programme had not been introduced. The model predicted that if prescreening trends continued (between 1987 and 1995) underlying incidence over this period would increase by 2.3 per 10,000 in women aged 50-54, 2.6 per 10,000 in women aged 55-59, and 2.9 per 10,000 in women aged 60-64. If the prescreening trends have continued then the use of a universal rate, applied across all calendar years and age groups, would seem to be inappropriate when setting targets.;J Med Screen. 1996.3(3):119-22.;Prior P1, Woodman CB, Wilson S, Threlfall AG.;8946305;Adult,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology,Breast Neoplasms/prevention & control,Cohort Studies,England/epidemiology,Female,Humans,Incidence,Mass Screening/standards*,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical,Reproducibility of Results,Wales/epidemiology;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Breast Neoplasms;;model valid;0.324"one",Screening women aged 40-49 years: where are we today?;;;;7563159;Comment,Editorial,Adult,Age Factors,American Cancer Society,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis,Breast Neoplasms/mortality*,Breast Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Computer Simulation,Female,Humans,Mammography*,Mass Screening*,Middle Aged,National Institutes of Health (U.S.),Population Surveillance,Sweden,United States;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Breast Neoplasms;;model valid;0.224"valid",Modelling issues in cancer screening.;Abstract The two main goals of modelling cancer screening are data analysis and evaluation. In data analysis, analytical-numerical statistical models are used to test hypotheses about preclinical disease, the screening test, and the association between early detection and risk of dying from the cancer. Evaluation in cancer screening is supported by model-based prediction of screening effects and cost-effectiveness. Simulation models are suitable for these tasks, and can also be used to identify efficient age-ranges and intervals between screening tests. Striking differences exist between screening models for cervical cancer and breast cancer, which are the two cancer types for which screening is common practice. The two main problems in cervical cancer screening are the proportion of progressive and regressive among screen-detected lesions, and the impact of screening on incidence and mortality. In breast cancer, regression is not (yet) a big issue, and the relationship between screening and mortality reduction has been demonstrated in randomized controlled trials (at least for women older than 50 years). The weakest link in current breast cancer models is the association between earliness of detection and improvement in prognosis. The modelling outcomes and their usefulness are decisively influenced by the data sets that were used in quantifying the model, and the subclassifications of the data that were considered. New or pending modelling issues include HPV-based screening in cervical cancer, screening models for colorectal cancer, the use of surrogate outcome measures and model-based meta-analysis of screening trials.;Stat Methods Med Res. 1995 Mar.4(1):33-54.;van Oortmarssen GJ1, Boer R, Habbema JD.;7613637;Review,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology,Breast Neoplasms/prevention & control,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Epidemiologic Methods*,Female,Humans,Mass Screening/statistics & numerical data*,Models, Statistical,Neoplasms/epidemiology,Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control;Breast Neoplasms,Primary Prevention,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms,Early Detection of Cancer;;model valid;0.428"not valid",MBS: a model for risk benefit analysis of breast cancer screening.;Abstract Breast cancer screening programmes employing mammography are being implemented in various European countries. Different screening protocols are used in demonstration projects and nationwide programmes. To evaluate and improve protocols, a computer model for the evaluation of breast cancer screening has been developed. The availability of such a model can be of great importance in obtaining a better insight into the influence of various parameters. The Monte Carlo computer model is based on random selection from distributions of relevant parameters including tumour onset, tumour growth rate, lifetime expectancy, tumour detection size for screening and spontaneous observation. The radiation risk is calculated for various screening protocols employing multiplicative and additive risk models combined with lifetime expectancy, number of females screened and absorbed dose per screening session. The benefit is calculated on the basis of the reduction in tumour size at detection due to screening compared with spontaneous observation and the survival as a function of tumour diameter. Data from the Swedish two-county study are used to validate the model in terms of prevalence, interval tumour rates and interval tumour diameter distributions. Except for the spontaneous tumour diameter distribution, the model can describe the Swedish two-county study. Specific information is presented on the distributions of relevant parameters.;Br J Radiol. 1995 Feb.68(806):141-9.;Jansen JT1, Zoetelief J.;7735744;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Age Factors,Aged,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology,Breast Neoplasms/pathology,Breast Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Computer Simulation*,Female,Humans,Mammography*/adverse effects,Mass Screening/adverse effects,Mass Screening/methods*,Middle Aged,Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/etiology,Reproducibility of Results,Risk Assessment,Sweden;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Breast Neoplasms;;model valid;0.372"not valid",Validation of the Gail et al. model for predicting individual breast cancer risk.;Abstract BACKGROUND: The Gail et al. model is considered the best available means for estimating an individual woman's risk of developing breast cancer. Such estimates are useful in decision making on the part of women, in designing prevention trials, and in targeting screening and prevention efforts. PURPOSE: Our purpose was to evaluate the ability of the model to accurately predict individual breast cancer risk, using a large population independent of the one from which the model was derived. METHODS: We compared the number of cancer cases predicted by the model to the actual number of cases observed in the Nurses' Health Study. The study population was 115,172 women who did not have breast cancer at the beginning of the study. Questionnaires were sent to participants every 2 years, seeking data on risk factors and diagnoses of breast cancer. Follow-up compliance was 95% over the 12-year study period. RESULTS: The model over-predicted absolute breast cancer risk by 33% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 28%-39%), with the overprediction more than twofold among premenopausal women (95% CI = 1.9-2.2), among women with extensive family history of breast cancer (95% CI = 1.1-3.9), and among women with age at first birth younger than 20 years (95% CI = 1.3-4.7). The correlation coefficient between observed and predicted risk was 0.67, indicating that the model is less than satisfactory for ranking individual levels of breast cancer risk. Overprediction occurred at all deciles of predicted risk. CONCLUSIONS: The model's performance is unsatisfactory for estimating breast cancer risk for individual women aged 25-61 years who do not participate in annual screening. Lower mammography screening rates in the Nurses' Health Study may account for some, but not all, of the discrepancy between observed and predicted cases. IMPLICATIONS: A recent modification of the model by the tamoxifen trial investigators is likely to have provided accurate power calculations. This modified form of the model should be useful for planning other large, population-based studies.;J Natl Cancer Inst. 1994 Apr 20.86(8):600-7.;Spiegelman D1, Colditz GA, Hunter D, Hertzmark E.;8145275;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.,Adult,Age Factors,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Evaluation Studies as Topic,Female,Humans,Incidence,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical*,Poisson Distribution,Risk Factors,Surveys and Questionnaires,United States/epidemiology,CA40356/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Breast Neoplasms;;model valid;0.188"one",Cost-effectiveness of mammographic screening in Australia.;Abstract The purpose of this research was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of mammographic screening to supplement the results of the National Evaluation of Breast Cancer Screening which identified the mortality benefit as the most sensitive parameter. This appraisal used a different computer model, MISCAN, which models the effects of introducing a national screening program into a previously unscreened population, rather than basing estimates on the assumption of a fully established program. For the 40 to 49 age group a mortality reduction of 8 per cent was assumed, rather than the 30 per cent estimate utilised in the National Evaluation. The revised estimate is based on the two Swedish trials (Malmo and WE). New estimates for treatment costs were also incorporated into the MISCAN model. The cost-effectiveness of the policy recommended in the National Evaluation Report, $11,000 per life year saved with two-yearly screening of women over 40, is estimated by the MISCAN model to be $20,300. These differences arise partly from the difference in mortality effects for the 40 to 49 age group, but also from differences inherent in the steady-state and dynamic population approaches to modelling premature deaths averted. The MISCAN results confirm that screening for women over 50 is more cost-effective than screening women under 50. Screening all women aged 50 to 69 every two to three years is reasonable value for money. For women aged 40 to 49 the mortality benefit and cost-effectiveness is less clear, and it would be prudent to allow screening in this group until further evidence is available.;Aust J Public Health. 1993 Mar.17(1):42-50.;Carter R1, Glasziou P, van Oortmarssen G, de Koning H, Stevenson C, Salkeld G, Boer R.;8357894;Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.,Adult,Aged,Australia,Breast Neoplasms/mortality,Breast Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Female,Humans,Mammography/economics*,Mass Screening/economics*,Mass Screening/methods,Middle Aged,Models, Econometric,Quality of Life,Value of Life*;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Breast Neoplasms;;model valid;0.624"not valid",[The economic evaluation of the early diagnosis of breast carcinoma: a review of the literature].;Abstract This paper reviews the economic aspects of screening for breast cancer: from a bibliographic search we identified studies on complete economic evaluation of screening programs in different parts of the world. At the methodological level, it goes as far as proposing a reference model for economic evaluation. An examination of the results obtained from various studies indicates that the introduction of screening program involves a cost per life-year saved of between 3,800 and 88,000 dollars. Allowing for quality of life, the range is 4,050 to 91,650 dollars. A discussion of some examples of sensitivity analysis shows how, and how much, the results change as a consequence of different assumptions regarding crucial variables: discount rate, reference period of the analysis, frequency of screening, age of the target population, volume of activity of each screening unit, compliance, sensitivity and specificity of the test.;Epidemiol Prev. 1992 Dec.14(53):22-31.;Vanara F1.;1341665;English Abstract,Review,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/economics*,Breast Neoplasms/prevention & control,Carcinoma/diagnosis*,Carcinoma/economics*,Carcinoma/prevention & control,Costs and Cost Analysis,Female,Humans,Mass Screening/economics,Mass Screening/organization & administration,Models, Organizational,Models, Statistical,Sensitivity and Specificity,Time Factors;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Breast Neoplasms;;model valid;0.492"one",[Natural history of minimal and occult breast cancers.

On the other hand, the decreased remaining life expectancy of older women can be expected to reduce the cost effectiveness of screening. To assess these competing factors, the cost effectiveness of a long-term breast cancer screening program was evaluated using a computerized simulation model. The cost per life year saved decreased when the 65-69 year age group was added to a program screening women aged 50-64. For older age groups, however, cost effectiveness became relatively less favorable. The cost per life year saved of screening the 80-84 year age group was 55% higher than for the 65-69 group.;J Gerontol. 1992 Nov.47 Spec No:51-8.;Brown ML1.;1430883;Review,Aged*,Breast Neoplasms/economics*,Breast Neoplasms/prevention & control,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Costs and Cost Analysis*,Female,Humans,Mammography/economics,Mass Screening/economics,Mass Screening/methods;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Breast Neoplasms;;model valid;0.572"not valid",Overview of guidelines for screening.;Abstract Controlled trials of screening for breast cancer have proven that (1) for women older than 50 years of age, screening with single-view or two-view mammography, at intervals of 1 to 3 years, with or without clinical examination reduces mortality.

(3) screening this age group with single-view mammography, at intervals of 20 months or longer, without clinical or BSE results in excess mortality in women screened. (3) screening this age group annually with poor quality mammography, weakly interpreted, with some clinical examination results in excess deaths in screened women.

The question is whether taking into account the impact of a screening programme on quality of life would lead to a less positive view. Screening may have effects on quality of life in the short run for women participating and effects in the long run as a result of the expected shift in the number of women experiencing early and advanced phases of the disease, after the initiation of the programme. In this study 4 steps have been taken: (I) published studies on quality of life and breast cancer (screening) up to 1989 have been reviewed and summarized and, based on these data, the consequences of breast cancer and treatment have been described. (2) values have been assigned to the disease and treatment phases by experts in breast cancer and public health (N = 31, response 87%). (3) these values have been inserted in the MISCAN model predicting the prevalence of disease/treatment phases with and without a 2-yearly screening programme for women aged 50-70 and multiplied by the duration of these phases. (4) analyses have been done to establish the sensitivity of the results for the values inserted. The programme of 2-yearly mammographic screening for women aged 50-70 is predicted to be 8% ""less effective"" (range -19.7 to +3.2%) when computing quality-adjusted life-years.

In this analysis of breast cancer screening, the authors used Japanese data in a cost-effectiveness model to compare the following five strategies: (1) no screening (N). (2) physical examination alone (PE). (3) mammography (MG). (4) PE followed by MG if PE findings were abnormal (PE----MG). and (5) PE combined with MG for all screened women (PE + MG). None of these programs would save medical expenditures. The total discounted net costs per patient (in US dollars) were as follows: N, +54. PE, +412. MG, +517. PE----MG, +340. and PE + MG, +731. The number of years of life saved per cohort of 100,000 asymptomatic Japanese women would range from 708 (PE----MG) to 3724 (PG + MG). The additional cost of each strategy (compared with N) per additional year of life would be +49,700 for PE, +40,400 for PE----MG, +14,300 for MG, and +18,000 for PE + MG. The least costly screening option (PE----MG) does not have the lowest cost per additional year of life saved (MG does).

For 3000 of them treated prior to the introduction of adjuvant chemotherapy, the follow-up ranges from 15 to 32 years. For all patients, the size of the primary tumor, its histologic grade, and the number of involved axillary nodes at the time of initial treatment were registered prospectively. This series of patients was used to analyze the relationship between the size of the primary tumor and the probability of distant metastatic spread, taking into account other prognostic variables. A simulation model of the natural history of breast cancer was built which satisfactorily fits the available data on breast cancer screening. The aim of this paper is to use this model to assess the influence of: a) the time interval between mammographies and b) the diagnostic ability of the screening program, on the proportion of patients with distant metastases. The results show that the proportion of patients with distant metastases at the time of diagnosis increases gradually from approximately 25% for an interval of 1 year to 40% for an interval of 5 years. Moreover, the proportion of patients with metastases is critically influenced by the size of the tumors which can be detected. for example, for a 2-year interval the proportion of patients with metastases increases from 32% for tumors screened of 1 cm in diameter to 40% for tumors of 1.7 cm in diameter.;Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1990 Nov.19(5):1117-20.;Tubiana M1, Koscielny S.;2254099;Breast Neoplasms/pathology*,Breast Neoplasms/prevention & control,Female,Humans,Mammography*,Mass Screening*,Neoplasm Metastasis/pathology,Neoplasm Metastasis/prevention & control; Early Detection of Cancer, Combined Modality Therapy, Breast Neoplasms,Primary Prevention,Early Detection of Cancer;;model valid;0.268"not valid",[A simple mathematical model for a quantitative evaluation of mass screening for detection of cancer].;Abstract In Japan, where the mass screening of various cancer are actively pursued under the auspices of the Adult Health Promotion Act of the Japanese Government, the incidence rate of various cancers has been undergoing a drastic change since 1960. Cancers of stomach and uterine cervix, which had predominated, are decreasing steadily, whereas lung, colon and breast cancers are rapidly increasing. To provide therapeutic care on the basis of accurate data, the mass screening system must be re-evaluated so as to maintain its effectiveness and efficiency. For this purpose, a simple, deterministic model is proposed to measure the cost-effectiveness of the mass screening quantitatively. The effect of the screening is estimated by the net number of lives that have been saved by the screening, with the final result being shown as the cost require to save one life of a certain age and sex. The model, although only an approximation, fits all kinds of cancers by changing the parameters employed in the mathematical equation, and has been found useful for forecasting the results of future mass screenings for the detection of cancers in Japan.;Gan No Rinsho. 1990 Nov.36(14):2427-33.;Iinuma T1, Tateno Y.;2250365;English Abstract,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Humans,Mass Screening*,Mathematics,Models, Statistical*,Stomach Neoplasms/epidemiology,Stomach Neoplasms/mortality,Stomach Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Survival Rate;Breast Neoplasms,Primary Prevention,Lung Neoplasms,Early Detection of Cancer;;model valid;0.316"not valid",Significance tests for cancer screening trials.;Abstract The goal of a cancer screening program is to reduce cancer mortality by detecting tumors at earlier stages of their development. For some types of cancer, screening tests may allow the preclinical detection of benign precursors of a tumor, and thus a screening program could result in reductions in both cancer incidence and mortality. For other types of cancer, a screening program will not reduce cancer incidence, and thus the expected outcome in a randomized cancer screening trial would be equal cancer incidence rates in control and study groups, but reduced cancer mortality in the study group. For the latter situation, we employ a variety of Poisson models for cancer incidence and mortality to derive optimal tests for equality of cancer mortality rates in a cancer screening trial, and we compare the asymptotic relative efficiencies of the test statistics under various alternatives. We demonstrate that testing equality of case mortality rates using Fisher's exact test or its Pearson chi-square approximation is nearly optimal when cancer incidence rates are equal and is fully efficient when cancer incidence rates are unequal. When valid, this comparison of case mortality rates in the study and control groups can be considerably more powerful than the standard comparison of population mortality rates.

The aim of this study is to estimate whether the additional benefits of FIT screening compared to gFOBT outweigh the additional costs and harms. METHODS: We used microsimulation modeling to estimate quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained and costs of gFOBT and FIT, compared to no screening, in a cohort of screening participants. We compared strategies with various age ranges, screening intervals, and cut-off levels for FIT. Cost-efficient strategies were determined for various levels of available colonoscopy capacity. RESULTS: Compared to no screening, biennial gFOBT screening between age 50-74 years provided 20 QALYs at a cost of CAN$200,900 per 1,000 participants, and required 17 colonoscopies per 1,000 participants per year. FIT screening was more effective and less costly. For the same level of colonoscopy requirement, biennial FIT (with a high cut-off level of 200 ng Hb/ml) between age 50-74 years provided 11 extra QALYs gained while saving CAN$333,300 per 1000 participants, compared to gFOBT. Without restrictions in colonoscopy capacity, FIT (with a low cut-off level of 50 ng Hb/ml) every year between age 45-80 years was the most cost-effective strategy providing 27 extra QALYs gained per 1000 participants, while saving CAN$448,300. INTERPRETATION: Compared to gFOBT screening, switching to FIT at a high cut-off level could increase the health benefits of a CRC screening program without considerably increasing colonoscopy demand.;PLoS One. 2017 Mar 15.12(3):e0172864. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0172864. eCollection 2017.;Goede SL1, Rabeneck L2,3,4, van Ballegooijen M1, Zauber AG5, Paszat LF3, Hoch JS3,6, Yong JH6, Kroep S1, Tinmouth J3,7, Lansdorp-Vogelaar I1.;28296927;Colorectal Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Feces*,Guaiac,Humans,Immunochemistry,Occult Blood*,Quality of Life,Guaiac,P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,U01 CA199335/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Colorectal Neoplasms;;model valid;0.668"one",Comparative Effectiveness and Cost Effectiveness of a Multitarget Stool DNA Test to Screen for Colorectal Neoplasia.;Abstract BACKGROUND & AIMS: We developed a model to determine whether a multitarget stool DNA (MT-sDNA) test that detects colorectal cancer (CRC) and polyps with higher sensitivity and lower specificity, but at a higher cost, than the fecal immunochemical test (FIT) can be used in screening. METHODS: We used a Markov model of average-risk CRC screening to compare the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of screening with the MT-sDNA test vs FIT or colonoscopy. We accounted for the complex longitudinal participation patterns observed in organized programs vs opportunistic screening, as well as organized programs' patient support costs and differential payment rates by commercial insurers vs Medicare. RESULTS: With optimal adherence, yearly FIT and colonoscopy every 10 years were dominant (more effective and less costly) than MT-sDNA every 3 years. Compared with successful organized FIT programs (50% consistent and 27% intermittent participation. patient support costs, $153/cycle), the patient support program for the MT-sDNA test would need 68% of subjects to participate consistently and 32% to participate intermittently every 3 years, or the MT-sDNA test would need to cost 60% less than in the base case ($260 commercial payment and $197 Medicare payment), for the MT-sDNA test to be preferred over FIT at a threshold of $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Compared with opportunistic yearly FIT screening (15% consistent and 30% intermittent participation), performing the MT-sDNA test every 3 years would cost less than $100,000 per QALY gained if the MT-sDNA test achieved a participation rate more than 1.7-fold that of FIT. The results were robust in sensitivity analyses. Assuming equal participation across strategies and a threshold of $100,000 per QALY gained, FIT was preferred in 99.3% of iterations in Monte Carlo simulation. CONCLUSIONS: In a Markov model, we found FIT and colonoscopy to be more effective and less costly than the MT-sDNA test when participation rates were equal for all strategies. For the MT-sDNA test to be cost effective, the patient support program included in its cost would need to achieve substantially higher participation rates than those of FIT, whether in organized programs or under the opportunistic screening setting that is more common in the United States than in the rest of the world.

The present study aimed to examine the cost-effectiveness of colorectal cancer screening using Japanese data to identify the optimal use of total colonoscopy and fecal immunochemical test. METHODS: We developed a Markov model to assess the cost-effectiveness of colorectal cancer screening offered to an average-risk population aged 40 years or over. The cost, quality-adjusted life-years and number of total colonoscopy procedures required were evaluated for three screening strategies: (i) a fecal immunochemical test-based strategy. (ii) a total colonoscopy-based strategy. (iii) a strategy of adding population-wide total colonoscopy at 50 years to a fecal immunochemical test-based strategy. RESULTS: All three strategies dominated no screening. Among the three, Strategy 1 was dominated by Strategy 3, and the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-years gained for Strategy 2 against Strategies 1 and 3 were JPY 293 616 and JPY 781 342, respectively. Within the Japanese threshold (JPY 5-6 million per QALY gained), Strategy 2 was the most cost-effective, followed by Strategy 3. however, Strategy 2 required more than double the number of total colonoscopy procedures than the other strategies. CONCLUSIONS: The total colonoscopy-based strategy could be the most cost-effective for population-based colorectal cancer screening in Japan. However, it requires more total colonoscopy procedures than the other strategies. Depending on total colonoscopy capacity, the strategy of adding total colonoscopy for individuals at a specified age to a fecal immunochemical test-based screening may be an optimal solution. � The Author 2015.

We used microsimulation modeling to estimate the cumulative number of CRC deaths prevented and colonoscopies performed between 2008 and 2038 with this family history-based screening program, compared to a regular gFOBT program. In both programs, we assumed screening uptake increased from 30% (participation level in 2008 before the program was launched) to 60%. We assumed that 11% of the population had a family history, defined as having at least one first-degree relative diagnosed with CRC. The programs offered screening between age 50 and 74 years, every two years for gFOBT, and every ten years for colonoscopy. Compared to opportunistic screening (2008 participation level kept constant at 30%), the gFOBT program cumulatively prevented 6,700 more CRC deaths and required 570,000 additional colonoscopies by 2038. The family history-based screening program increased these numbers to 9,300 and 1,100,000, a 40% and 93% increase, respectively. If biennial gFOBT was replaced with biennial fecal immunochemical test (FIT), annual Hemoccult Sensa or five-yearly sigmoidoscopy screening, both the added benefits and colonoscopies required would decrease. A biennial gFOBT screening program that identifies individuals with a family history of CRC and recommends them to undergo colonoscopy screening would prevent 40% (range in sensitivity analyses: 20-51%) additional deaths while requiring 93% (range: 43-116%) additional colonoscopies, compared to a regular gFOBT screening program.;Int J Cancer. 2015 Sep 1.137(5):1119-27. doi: 10.1002/ijc.29473.

In the district of Florence, an organized screening programme based on faecal immunochemical test has been running since the early 1990s. The aim of this study was to compare the risk of developing colorectal cancer for subjects undergoing faecal immunochemical test with those who did not undergo the test in the same period. METHODS: Two cohorts were analyzed: subjects who underwent an initial faecal immunochemical test between 1993 and 1999 (""attenders""), and unscreened residents in the same municipalities invited to perform the faecal immunochemical test in the same period (""non-attenders""). Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analysis were performed to evaluate the risk of developing colorectal cancer. RESULTS: The attenders' and non-attenders' cohorts included 6961 and 26,285 subjects, respectively. Cox analysis showed a reduction in colorectal cancer incidence of 22% in the attenders' compared to the non-attenders' cohort (hazard ratio = 0.78, 95% Confidence Interval: 0.65-0.93). CONCLUSION: Our results support the hypothesis that screening based on a single faecal immunochemical test every 2 years produces a significant decrease in colorectal cancer incidence after an average follow-up observation period of 11 years.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness and costs of colonoscopy versus other rescreening strategies after an initial negative colonoscopy result. DESIGN: Microsimulation model. DATA SOURCES: Literature and data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program. TARGET POPULATION: Persons aged 50 years who had no adenomas or cancer detected on screening colonoscopy. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTION: No further screening or rescreening starting at age 60 years with colonoscopy every 10 years, annual highly sensitive guaiac fecal occult blood testing (HSFOBT), annual fecal immunochemical testing (FIT), or computed tomographic colonography (CTC) every 5 years. OUTCOME MEASURES: Lifetime cases of colorectal cancer, life expectancy, and lifetime costs per 1000 persons, assuming either perfect or imperfect adherence. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Rescreening with any method substantially reduced the risk for colorectal cancer compared with no further screening (range, 7.7 to 12.6 lifetime cases per 1000 persons [perfect adherence] and 17.7 to 20.9 lifetime cases per 1000 persons [imperfect adherence] vs. 31.3 lifetime cases per 1000 persons with no further screening). In both adherence scenarios, the differences in life-years across rescreening strategies were small (range, 30 893 to 30 902 life-years per 1000 persons [perfect adherence] vs. 30 865 to 30 869 life-years per 1000 persons [imperfect adherence]). Rescreening with HSFOBT, FIT, or CTC had fewer complications and was less costly than continuing colonoscopy. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Results were sensitive to test-specific adherence rates. LIMITATION: Data on adherence to rescreening were limited. CONCLUSION: Compared with the currently recommended strategy of continuing colonoscopy every 10 years after an initial negative examination, rescreening at age 60 years with annual HSFOBT, annual FIT, or CTC every 5 years provides approximately the same benefit in life-years with fewer complications at a lower cost. Therefore, it is reasonable to use other methods to rescreen persons with negative colonoscopy results.

STUDY DESIGN: In 2008, 58,440 Kaiser Permanente Colorado members unscreened for CRC received an interactive voice response (IVR) call followed by mailed fecal immunochemical test (FIT), or colonoscopy if requested. We used a quasi-experimental design with staged implementation, in which a random subset of eligible members was selected each week to receive the intervention. This design allowed the entire group to ultimately receive the intervention. METHODS: Survival models summarized time-specific comparisons of screening behaviors for members who received immediate outreach compared with those who had not yet received it. RESULTS: A total of 26,003 (45%) of the unscreened population completed screening, predominately due to the mailed kits. The unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) for the outreach effect on screening completion was 4.08 (95% confidence interval: 3.93-4.25) and adjusted HR was 3.75 (3.60-3.91). Lower levels of screening were seen in African Americans (HR 0.83. 0.77-0.90) and Hispanics (HR 0.84. 0.80-0.88) compared with whites, and in smokers (HR 0.77. 0.74-0.80) compared with nonsmokers. The outreach had greater impact among those without a primary care (HR 4.5 vs 3.0, P <.0001) or specialty care (HR 5.2 vs 3.5, P <.0001) visit compared with those with 1 or more visits. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of colorectal cancer screening in members after mailed FIT with IVR was almost 4 times higher than usual care, particularly in those without an office visit.

METHODS: Retrospective study by application of a three-step model designed for a local setting in Sicily (Palermo and its Province) in order to distribute Fecal Occult Blood Tests (FOBTs), offer colonoscopy and surgery, by district allocation of pharmacies, public digestive endoscopic centres and oncologic and general surgery units. Mean adherence to consolidated colorectal screening programs in Italy was applied in order to evaluate the feasibility of an operative model in our area. RESULTS: Applying the model to the target population (269,368 individuals of both sexes), it can be expected a mean percentage of 79% delivered invitation and a mean participation rate of 46.3% accounting for a total of 213,070 invited individuals and 98,651 participating in the first round of the program. Furthermore, considering the national mean of 6% positive FOBT, 82% of colonscopy adhesion and 7% CRC detection rate, it can be scheduled a burden for health care structures involved in the program accounting for 49,325 FOBTs, 2,338 colonscopies and 141 surgeries for each year. DISCUSSION: This work demonstrates the feasibility of a colorectal screening project in our area, showing a sustainable impact for local health care involved structures. Furthermore, this program may be spread as an applicative model to other areas, adapting the project to the needs of the local setting in which the colorectal screening will be organized.;J Prev Med Hyg. 2011 Dec.52(4):191-5.;Costantino C1, Calamusa G, Cusimano R, Firenze A, Romano N, Trecca A, Vitale F.;22442924;Carcinoma/diagnosis,Carcinoma/economics,Carcinoma/prevention & control,Colonoscopy,Colorectal Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Colorectal Neoplasms/economics,Colorectal Neoplasms/prevention & control,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Feasibility Studies,Female,Humans,Italy,Male,Mass Screening*/economics,Models, Economic*,Occult Blood,Retrospective Studies; Early Detection of Cancer, Combined Modality Therapy, Colorectal Neoplasms,Primary Prevention,Early Detection of Cancer;;model valid;0.564"not valid",How should individuals with a false-positive fecal occult blood test for colorectal cancer be managed? A decision analysis.;Abstract Several industrialized nations recommend fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) to screen for colorectal cancer (CRC), but corresponding screening guidelines do not specify how individuals with a prior false-positive FOBT result (fpFOBT) should be managed in terms of subsequent CRC screening. Accordingly, we conducted a decision analysis to compare different strategies for managing such individuals. We used a previously developed CRC microsimulation model, SimCRC, to calculate life-years and the lifetime number of colonoscopies (as a measure of required resources) for a cohort of 50-year-olds to whom FOBT-based CRC screening is offered annually from 50 to 75 years. We compared three management strategies for individuals with a prior fpFOBT: (i) resume screening in 10 years with 10-yearly colonoscopy (SwitchCol_long). (ii) resume screening in 1 year with annual FOBT (ContinueFOBT_Short) and (iii) resume screening in 10 years (i.e., the recommended interval following a negative colonoscopy) with annual FOBT (ContinueFOBT_long). We performed sensitivity analyses on various parameters and assumptions. When using different management strategies for individuals with a prior fpFOBT, the variation in the number of life-years gained relative to no screening was <2%, whereas the variation in the lifetime number of colonoscopies was 23% (percentages are calculated as the maximum difference across strategies divided by the lowest number across strategies). The ContinueFOBT_long strategy showed the lowest lifetime number of colonoscopies per life-year gained even when key assumptions were varied. In conclusion, the ContinueFOBT_long strategy was advantageous regarding both clinical benefit and required resources. Specifying an appropriate management strategy for individuals with a prior fpFOBT may substantially reduce required resources within a FOBT-based CRC screening program without limiting its effectiveness.;Int J Cancer. 2012 Nov 1.131(9):2094-102. doi: 10.1002/ijc.27463.

Simulation from ongoing Italian screening experiences.;Abstract AIMS AND BACKGROUND: The best screening strategy for colorectal cancer is still debated. We simulated two screening strategies, namely flexible sigmoidoscopy (single episode) and immunological fecal occult blood test (FOBT) (five biennial rounds) and comparing their results as regards advanced adenomas and colorectal cancer detection. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to estimate the number of advanced adenomas and colorectal cancer detected with the two compared screening strategies. Two different scenarios, namely a) where the same compliance (50%) at both flexible sigmoidoscopy and immunological FOBT invitation is applied, and b) where the actual compliance observed at a national level (immunological FOBT, 45%. flexible sigmoidoscopy, 30%) is applied. RESULTS: In scenario a), immunological FOBT would detect a total of 20,573 adenomas and 3,952 colorectal cancers, performing 74,507 total colonoscopies compared to 20,939 and 2,511, respectively, detected by flexible sigmoidoscopy, with 17,985 total colonoscopies. In scenario b), immunological FOBT would detect 17,845 advanced adenomas with 65,215 colonoscopies performed compared to 12,672 detected by flexible sigmoidoscopy with 10,796 colonoscopies. The probability of having a colonoscopy for a subject attending all the five immunological FOBT rounds was 15.9%. CONCLUSIONS: The simulation suggests that also immunological FOBT screening may achieve a substantial detection of advanced adenomas and therefore may have an impact on colorectal cancer incidence.;Tumori. 2011 Sep-Oct.97(5):547-50. doi: 10.1700/989.10709.;Ventura L1, Zappa M, Carreras G, Ciatto S, Grazzini G.;22158481;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adenoma/diagnosis,Adenoma/epidemiology,Carcinoma/diagnosis,Carcinoma/epidemiology,Colonoscopy,Colorectal Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Colorectal Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Colorectal Neoplasms/pathology,Early Detection of Cancer/methods*,Female,Humans,Italy/epidemiology,Male,Mass Screening/methods*,Occult Blood*,Patient Compliance/statistics & numerical data,Sigmoidoscopy*/statistics & numerical data;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Colorectal Neoplasms;;model valid;0.364"one",Costs and cost-effectiveness of full implementation of a biennial faecal occult blood test screening program for bowel cancer in Australia.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: To examine the costs and cost-effectiveness of full implementation of biennial bowel cancer screening for Australian residents aged 50-74 years. DESIGN AND SETTING: Identification of existing economic models from 1993 to 2010 through searches of PubMed and economic analysis databases, and by seeking expert advice. and additional modelling to determine the costs and cost-effectiveness of full implementation of biennial faecal occult blood test screening for the five million adults in Australia aged 50-74 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Estimated number of deaths from bowel cancer prevented, costs, and cost-effectiveness (cost per life-year gained [LYG]) of biennial bowel cancer screening. RESULTS: We identified six relevant economic analyses, all of which found colorectal cancer (CRC) screening to be very cost-effective, with costs per LYG under $55,000 per year in 2010 Australian dollars. Based on our additional modelling, we conservatively estimate that full implementation of biennial screening for people aged 50-74 years would have gross costs of $150 million, reduce CRC mortality by 15%-25%, prevent 300-500 deaths from bowel cancer, and save 3600-6000 life-years annually, for an undiscounted cost per LYG of $25,000-$41,667, compared with no screening, and not taking cost savings as a result of treatment into consideration. The additional expenditure required, after accounting for reductions in CRC incidence, savings in CRC treatment costs, and existing ad-hoc colonoscopy use, is likely to be less than $50 million annually. CONCLUSIONS: Full implementation of biennial faecal occult blood test screening in Australia can reduce bowel cancer mortality, and is an efficient use of health resources that would require modest additional government investment.;Med J Aust. 2011 Feb 21.194(4):180-5.;Pignone MP1, Flitcroft KL, Howard K, Trevena LJ, Salkeld GP, St John DJ.;21401458;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Aged,Australia/epidemiology,Colonic Neoplasms/diagnosis,Colonic Neoplasms/economics,Colonic Neoplasms/mortality,Colonic Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Costs and Cost Analysis/economics,Costs and Cost Analysis/statistics & numerical data,Female,Humans,Male,Mass Screening/economics*,Middle Aged,Models, Economic,Occult Blood*,K05 CA129166/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,K05 CA129166-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Colorectal Neoplasms;;model valid;0.72"valid",Interval fecal immunochemical testing in a colonoscopic surveillance program speeds detection of colorectal neoplasia.;Abstract BACKGROUND & AIMS: Rapidly progressing or missed lesions can reduce the effectiveness of colonoscopy-based colorectal cancer surveillance programs. We investigated whether giving fecal immunochemical tests (FITs) for hemoglobin between surveillance colonoscopies resulted in earlier detection of neoplasia. METHODS: The study included 1736 patients with a family history or past neoplasia. they received at least 2 colonoscopy examinations and were followed for a total of 8863 years. Patients were excluded from the study if they had genetic syndromes, colorectal surgery, or inflammatory bowel disease. An FIT was offered yearly, in the interval between colonoscopies. if results were positive, the colonoscopy was performed earlier than scheduled. RESULTS: Among the 1071 asymptomatic subjects (61%) who received at least 1 FIT, the test detected 12 of 14 cancers (86% sensitivity) and 60 of 96 (63%) advanced adenomas. In patients with positive results from the FIT, the diagnosis of cancer was made 25 months (median) earlier and diagnosis of advanced adenoma 24 months earlier. Patients who had repeated negative results from FIT had an almost 2-fold decrease in risk for cancer and advanced adenoma compared with patients who were not tested (5.5% vs 10.1%, respectively, P = .0004). The most advanced stages of neoplasia, observed across the continuum from nonadvanced adenoma to late-stage cancer, were associated with age (increased with age), sex (increased in males), and FIT result. The probability of most advanced neoplastic stage was lowest among those with a negative result from the FIT (odds ratio, 0.68. P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Interval examinations using the FIT detected neoplasias sooner than scheduled surveillances. Subjects with negative results from the FIT had the lowest risk for the most advanced stage of neoplasia. Interval FIT analyses can be used to detect missed or rapidly developing lesions in surveillance programs. Copyright � 2010 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

For colorectal cancer screening, there is growing momentum to use colonoscopy, which is an expensive test. In this study, we modeled scenarios to assess whether the use of fecal occult blood tests or colonoscopy provides the most benefit under conditions of budget constraints. We found that although colonoscopy is more accurate, under most scenarios, fecal occult blood tests would result in more individuals' getting screened, with more life-years gained.;Health Aff (Millwood). 2010 Sep.29(9):1734-40. doi: 10.1377/hlthaff.2008.0898.

However, because of the number of tests available, the optimal screening strategy in Canada is unknown. We estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness of 10 strategies for colorectal cancer screening, as well as no screening, incorporating quality of life, noncompliance and data on the costs and benefits of chemotherapy. METHODS: We used a probabilistic Markov model to estimate the costs and quality-adjusted life expectancy of 50-year-old average-risk Canadians without screening and with screening by each test. We populated the model with data from the published literature. We calculated costs from the perspective of a third-party payer, with inflation to 2007 Canadian dollars. RESULTS: Of the 10 strategies considered, we focused on three tests currently being used for population screening in some Canadian provinces: low-sensitivity guaiac fecal occult blood test, performed annually. fecal immunochemical test, performed annually. and colonoscopy, performed every 10 years. These strategies reduced the incidence of colorectal cancer by 44%, 65% and 81%, and mortality by 55%, 74% and 83%, respectively, compared with no screening. These strategies generated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of $9159, $611 and $6133 per quality-adjusted life year, respectively. The findings were robust to probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Colonoscopy every 10 years yielded the greatest net health benefit. INTERPRETATION: Screening for colorectal cancer is cost-effective over conventional levels of willingness to pay. Annual high-sensitivity fecal occult blood testing, such as a fecal immunochemical test, or colonoscopy every 10 years offer the best value for the money in Canada.;CMAJ. 2010 Sep 7.182(12):1307-13. doi: 10.1503/cmaj.090845.

The current UK CRC screening programme is faecal occult blood testing (FOBT), despite evidence from modelling studies to suggest that more cost-effective technologies exist. OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost effectiveness of CT colonography (CTC) for colorectal cancer screening from the perspective of the UK NHS. METHODS: A state-transition Markov model was constructed to estimate lifetime costs and health outcomes of a cohort of individuals screened at age 60-69 years using four different CRC screening technologies: FOBT, flexible sigmoidoscopy, optical colonoscopy and CTC. RESULTS: CTC screening offered every 10 years was cost saving compared with the current UK programme of biennial FOBT screening. This strategy also yielded greater health benefits (QALYs and life-years) than biennial FOBT screening. The model fit observed CRC epidemiology data well and was robust to changes in underlying parameter values. CTC remained cost effective under a range of assumptions in the univariate sensitivity analysis. However, in the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, CTC dominated FOBT in only 5.9% of simulations and was cost effective at a threshold of pound30,000 per QALY gained in 48% of simulations. CONCLUSIONS: CTC has the potential to provide a cost-effective option for CRC screening in the UK NHS and may be cost saving compared with the current programme of biennial FOBT. Further analysis is required to assess the impact of introducing CTC to the UK CRC screening programme on the NHS budget and capacity.;Appl Health Econ Health Policy. 2010.8(3):141-54. doi: 10.2165/11535650-000000000-00000.;Lee D1, Muston D, Sweet A, Cunningham C, Slater A, Lock K.;20369905;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Aged,Colonography, Computed Tomographic/economics*,Colorectal Neoplasms/economics*,Colorectal Neoplasms/prevention & control,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Female,Humans,Male,Markov Chains,Mass Screening/economics*,Middle Aged,Occult Blood,Quality-Adjusted Life Years*,Sensitivity and Specificity,State Medicine/economics*,United Kingdom;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Colorectal Neoplasms;;model valid;0.788"not valid",Effect of rising chemotherapy costs on the cost savings of colorectal cancer screening.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Although colorectal cancer screening is cost-effective, it requires a considerable net investment by governments or insurance companies. If screening was cost saving, governments and insurance companies might be more inclined to invest in colorectal cancer screening programs. We examined whether colorectal cancer screening would become cost saving with the widespread use of the newer, more expensive chemotherapies. METHODS: We used the MISCAN-Colon microsimulation model to assess whether widespread use of new chemotherapies would affect the treatment savings of colorectal cancer screening in the general population. We considered three scenarios for chemotherapy use: the past, the present, and the near future. We assumed that survival improved and treatment costs for patients diagnosed with advanced stages of colorectal cancer increased over the scenarios. Screening strategies considered were annual guaiac fecal occult blood testing (FOBT), annual immunochemical FOBT, sigmoidoscopy every 5 years, colonoscopy every 10 years, and the combination of sigmoidoscopy every 5 years and annual guaiac FOBT. Analyses were conducted from the perspective of the health-care system for a cohort of 50-year-old individuals who were at average risk of colorectal cancer and were screened with 100% adherence from age 50 years to age 80 years and followed up until death. RESULTS: Compared with no screening, the treatment savings from preventing advanced colorectal cancer and colorectal cancer deaths by screening more than doubled with the widespread use of new chemotherapies. The lifetime average treatment savings were larger than the lifetime average screening costs for screening with Hemoccult II, immunochemical FOBT, sigmoidoscopy, and the combination of sigmoidoscopy and Hemoccult II (average savings vs costs per individual in the population: Hemoccult II, $1398 vs $859. immunochemical FOBT, $1756 vs $1565. sigmoidoscopy, $1706 vs $1575. sigmoidoscopy and Hemoccult II $1931 vs $1878). Colonoscopy did not become cost saving, but the total net costs of this strategy decreased from $1317 to $296 per individual in the population. CONCLUSIONS: With the increase in chemotherapy costs for advanced colorectal cancer, most colorectal cancer screening strategies have become cost saving. As a consequence, screening is a desirable approach not only to reduce colorectal cancer incidence and mortality but also to control the costs of colorectal cancer treatment.;J Natl Cancer Inst. 2009 Oct 21.101(20):1412-22. doi: 10.1093/jnci/djp319.

Most CRC models to date have assumed ""ideal conditions"" such as 100% compliance, and the effects of CRC screening tests have been assessed only under these conditions. In this study, we assess cost-effectiveness incorporating real-world patient preferences and compliance. METHODOLOGY: We built an agent-based simulation model to assess the effect of compliance and patient preferences. Baseline values were derived from the 2003 and 2005 National Health Interview Survey, and effectiveness and cost parameters were obtained through literature review. Initial screening compliance was 45%, and compliance with follow-up diagnostic tests was 75%. RESULTS: The current level of screening reduces CRC mortality by 44.1% when compared with no screening. Increasing diagnostic follow-up compliance to 95% can lead to an additional 9.3% reduction in CRC mortality, whereas increasing initial screening compliance to 95% can result in an additional 50.4% reduction. These increases can be achieved at a cost of about $7,500 ($1,309-$32,864) per life year saved and $14,000 ($3,620-$35,855) per life year saved for diagnostic follow-up and initial screening tests, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing compliance with both initial screening test recommendation and diagnostic testing are cost-effective approaches. The most cost-effective approach under limited funding is to increase compliance with diagnostic testing for those already being screened. Targeted interventions, which are necessary to increase compliance, are generally cost-effective under the base case scenarios presented in this model, but additional studies are required to identify the most cost-effective approach.";Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2009 Jul.18(7):1971-8. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-09-0083.

AIM: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of FOBT, FS and colonoscopy on the basis of disease prevalence, compliance rate and cost of screening procedures in Asian countries. METHODS: A hypothetical population of 100 000 persons aged 50 undergoes either FOBT annually, FS every 5 years or colonoscopy every 10 years until the age of 80 years. Patients with positive FOBT or polyp in FS are offered colonoscopy. Surveillance colonoscopy is repeated every 3 years. The treatment cost of CRC, including surgery and chemotherapy, was evaluated. A Markov model was used to compare the cost-effectiveness of different screening strategies. RESULTS: Assuming a compliance rate of 90%, colonoscopy, FS and FOBT can reduce CRC incidence by 54.1%, 37.1% and 29.3% respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for FOBT (US$6222 per life-year saved) is lower than FS (US$8044 per life-year saved) and colonoscopy (US$7211 per life-year saved). When the compliance rate drops to 50% and 30%, FOBT still has the lowest ICER.

METHODS: We analyzed data from a population-based cohort of 42,150 (20,326 men and 21,824 women) subjects. Subjects who had undergone fecal occult blood test (FOBT) screening during the preceding 12 months were defined as the screened group. A total of 132 colorectal cancer deaths and 597 cases of newly diagnosed colorectal cancer were identified during the follow-up period. RESULTS: We observed a nearly 70% decrease in colorectal cancer mortality in screened versus unscreened subjects (RR=0.28, 95% CI=0.13-0.61). Screening participation was associated with a 30% reduced risk of death from all causes other than colorectal cancer (RR=0.70, 95% CI=0.61-0.79). However, the extent of mortality reduction was greater for colorectal cancer than other causes. A significant decrease in the incidence of advanced colorectal cancer was seen in screened subjects (RR=0.41, 95% CI=0.27-0.63), although the overall incidence rate did not differ significantly between the screened and unscreened groups. CONCLUSION: Although self-selection bias could not be fully controlled, these findings suggest that colorectal cancer screening may be associated with a reduction in mortality from colorectal cancer in the Japanese population.;Cancer Detect Prev. 2007.31(1):3-11.

In Taiwan, we proposed community-based CRC screening using faecal occult blood tests (FOBT) within a multiple disease screening programme. AIMS: Based on early results from the screening programme, we aimed to compare the projected efficacies, in terms of reductions in CRC mortality, achieved with multiple disease screening, single disease screening and no screening programmes. METHODS: Annual FOBT has been included in the Keelung multiple disease screening programme. A total of 26,008 subjects were offered screening. Early indicators have been estimated to assess the potential effectiveness of this programme, including the Dukes' stage distribution of screen-detected cases, the proportionate incidence and the prevalence/incidence ratio. Transition rates according to adenoma size and Dukes' stage have been estimated from an eight-state Markov model. The projected mortality reductions based on this disease natural history have been estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation for both multiple screening and single screening. RESULTS: The overall attendance rate was 82% at the first screen and 87% at the second screen. At the first screen, 70% of screen-detected cases were localized (i.e. Dukes' stage A or B). The corresponding figure for the second screen was 80%. Approximately three-quarters of detected adenomas were smaller than 1 cm. The estimated mean transition times from diminutive adenoma to small adenoma, from small adenoma to large adenoma and from large adenoma to pre-clinical Dukes' A or B invasive carcinoma were 14.4, 5.4 and 5.6 years, respectively. Estimated reductions in CRC mortality, based on annual screening, are 23 and 33% for the single and multiple disease screening programmes, respectively. Multiple screening with an annual screening regime may lead to a further 13% reduction in mortality when compared to conventional single screening. CONCLUSION: Early indications suggest that population-based screening for CRC with FOBT, implemented through a multi-disease screening programme, is both feasible and efficacious. Further evaluation of the programme, through longer follow-up and cost-effectiveness analysis, is now required.;J Med Screen. 2006.13 Suppl 1:S8-13.;Yang KC1, Liao CS, Chiu YH, Yen AM, Chen TH.;17227635;Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Colorectal Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Colorectal Neoplasms/prevention & control,Humans,Markov Chains,Mass Screening/methods*,Mass Screening/statistics & numerical data,Middle Aged,Occult Blood*,Risk Factors,Taiwan;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Colorectal Neoplasms;;model valid;0.592"valid",Summaries for patients.

A cost-effectiveness analysis.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Aspirin may decrease colorectal cancer incidence, but its role as an adjunct to or substitute for screening has not been evaluated. OBJECTIVE: To examine the potential cost-effectiveness of aspirin chemoprophylaxis in relation to screening. DESIGN: Markov model. DATA SOURCES: Literature on colorectal cancer epidemiology, screening, costs, and aspirin chemoprevention (1980-1999). TARGET POPULATION: General U.S. population. TIME HORIZON: 50 to 80 years of age. PERSPECTIVE: Third-party payer. INTERVENTION: Aspirin therapy in patients screened with sigmoidoscopy every 5 years and fecal occult blood testing every year (FS/FOBT) or colonoscopy every 10 years (COLO). OUTCOME MEASURES: Discounted cost per life-year gained. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: When a 30% reduction in colorectal cancer risk was assumed, aspirin increased costs and decreased life-years because of related complications as an adjunct to FS/FOBT and cost $149 161 per life-year gained as an adjunct to COLO. In patients already taking aspirin, screening with FS/FOBT or COLO cost less than $31 000 per life-year gained. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Cost-effectiveness estimates depended highly on the magnitude of colorectal cancer risk reduction with aspirin, aspirin-related complication rates, and the screening adherence rate in the population. However, when the model's inputs were varied over wide ranges, aspirin chemoprophylaxis remained generally non-cost-effective for patients who adhere to screening. CONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing colorectal cancer screening, aspirin use should not be based on potential chemoprevention. Aspirin chemoprophylaxis alone cannot be considered a substitute for colorectal cancer screening. Public policy should focus on improving screening adherence, even in patients who are already taking aspirin.;Ann Intern Med. 2001 Nov 6.135(9):769-81.;Ladabaum U1, Chopra CL, Huang G, Scheiman JM, Chernew ME, Fendrick AM.;11694102;Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.,Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/economics,Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/therapeutic use*,Aspirin/economics,Aspirin/therapeutic use*,Colonoscopy/economics,Colorectal Neoplasms/epidemiology,Colorectal Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Decision Support Techniques,Humans,Markov Chains,Mass Screening/economics*,Occult Blood,Sensitivity and Specificity,Sigmoidoscopy/economics,Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal,Aspirin,M01-RR00042/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States,M01-RR00079/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Colorectal Neoplasms;;model valid;0.692"one",Impact of systematic false-negative test results on the performance of faecal occult blood screening.;Abstract The impact of systematic false-negative test results on mortality reduction and on programme sensitivity of annual faecal occult blood testing in ages 50-84 years is explored using a microsimulation model.

With 80% test sensitivity, the reduction in mortality due to screening decreases from 25% without systematic results to 23% when all false-negative results are systematic and the programme sensitivity decreases from 63 to 58%. With 30% test sensitivity, mortality reduction decreases from 21 to 11% and programme sensitivity decreases from 52 to 27%.

However, many aspects of different CRC screening strategies remain uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To assess the consequences, costs, and cost-effectiveness of CRC screening in average-risk individuals. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis from a societal perspective using a Markov model. SUBJECTS: Hypothetical subjects representative of the 50-year-old US population at average risk for CRC. SETTING: Simulated clinical practice in the United States. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Discounted lifetime costs, life expectancy, and incremental cost-effectiveness (CE) ratio, compared used 22 different CRC screening strategies, including those recommended by the expert panel. RESULTS: In 1 base-case analysis, compliance was assumed to be 60% with the initial screen and 80% with follow-up or surveillance colonoscopy. The most effective strategy for white men was annual rehydrated fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) plus sigmoidoscopy (followed by colonoscopy if either a low- or high-risk polyp was found) every 5 years from age 50 to 85 years, which resulted in a 60% reduction in cancer incidence and an 80% reduction in CRC mortality compared with no screening, and an incremental CE ratio of $92,900 per year of life gained compared with annual unrehydrated FOBT plus sigmoidoscopy every 5 years. In a base-case analysis in which compliance with screening and follow-up is assumed to be 100%, screening more often than every 10 years was prohibitively expensive. annual rehydrated FOBT plus sigmoidoscopy every 5 years had an incremental CE ratio of $489,900 per life-year gained compared with the same strategy every 10 years. Other strategies recommended by the expert panel were either less effective or cost more per year of life gained than the alternatives. Colonoscopy every 10 years was less effective than the combination of annual FOBT plus sigmoidoscopy every 5 years. However, a single colonoscopy at age 55 years achieves nearly half of the reduction in CRC mortality obtainable with colonoscopy every 10 years. Because of increased life expectancy among white women and increased cancer mortality among blacks, CRC screening was even more cost-effective in these groups than in white men. CONCLUSIONS: Screening for CRC, even in the setting of imperfect compliance, significantly reduces CRC mortality at costs comparable to other cancer screening procedures. However, compliance rates significantly affect the incremental CE ratios. In this model of CRC, 60% compliance with an every 5-year schedule of screening was roughly equivalent to 100% compliance with an every 10-year schedule. Mathematical modeling used to inform clinical guidelines needs to take into account expected compliance rates.

Some attribute a large part of this reduction to chance detection of cancers by colonoscopies. rehydration of guaiac test slides greatly increased positivity and consequently the number of colonoscopies performed. This study was conducted to determine how much of the reduction resulted from chance detection. METHODS: We used a mathematical model developed by Lang and Ransohoff to estimate the proportion of the 33.4% mortality attainable by chance alone. Applying the model requires the specification of five parameters: duration of follow-up, rate of compliance with fecal occult blood testing, rate of compliance with colonoscopy, positivity rate, and efficacy of colonoscopy in reducing colorectal cancer mortality. We took values for four of the five parameters directly from the Minnesota study. For the fifth parameter, efficacy of colonoscopy, we selected a value of 60%, based on the conclusions of another study. Whereas the Lang-Ransohoff model selects persons for colonoscopy by chance alone, those with bleeding cancers would also be selected by sensitive fecal occult blood testing. We therefore adjusted the result of the Lang-Ransohoff model for this dual detectability. RESULTS: We found that 16%-25% of the reduction in colorectal cancer deaths effected by fecal occult blood testing in the Minnesota study was due to chance detection. the remainder was due to sensitive detection.

The effect of each strategy on life expectancy and health care costs was estimated under assumptions that were uniformly unfavorable to screening. Cost and added years of life were discounted at 5% per year. Cost per year of life gained from screening was calculated for each screening strategy. DATA SOURCES: Assumptions used in the model were based on a review of pertinent studies. those studies with results more unfavorable to screening were given more weight. Strengths and weaknesses of studies are discussed. MAIN RESULTS: A program of annual fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) in the elderly would detect at least 17% of the expected cases of cancer and could cost $35,000 per year of life saved. Screening schedules that include periodic sigmoidoscopy would prevent more cases of cancer but could cost between $43,000 and $47,000 per year of life gained. These estimates are based on uncertain assumptions, but results were not extremely sensitive to further relaxation of the values of the most uncertain assumptions. In no case did the cost per year of life gained from annual FOBT exceed $55,000 or did the cost per year of life gained from FOBT with sigmoidoscopy every 5 years exceed $61,000. CONCLUSIONS: Although colorectal cancer screening is costly in the aggregate, its potential medical benefits make it a reasonably cost-effective preventive intervention for the elderly.;Ann Intern Med. 1991 Nov 15.115(10):807-17.;Wagner JL1, Herdman RC, Wadhwa S.;1929029;Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Colorectal Neoplasms/economics*,Colorectal Neoplasms/prevention & control,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Humans,Intestinal Polyps/economics,Life Expectancy,Mass Screening/economics*,Models, Econometric,Occult Blood,Sensitivity and Specificity,Sigmoidoscopy;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Colorectal Neoplasms;;model valid;0.692"one",The cost of screening for colorectal cancer.;"Abstract STUDY OBJECTIVE: The aim was to make projections of the likely costs and yield resulting from the implementation of a faecal occult blood screening programme for colorectal cancer. DESIGN: Cost and clinical data were derived from the MRC colorectal screening trial currently in progress in Nottingham, UK. SETTING: The above data were used as the basis for modelling the likely implications were the trial to be reproduced as a screening programme within a ""typical"" family practitioner committee area. MAIN RESULTS: For an average family practitioner committee area with a target population of 75,000 subjects aged 50-74 years, the initial screening round might be expected to detect 85 cancers at a total cost of approximately 250,000 pounds. This represents a cost per cancer detected of 2700 pounds and a cost per person screened of approximately 5 pounds. For subsequent screening rounds, total costs might be expected to fall although average costs are likely to remain approximately constant. CONCLUSIONS: The model is successful in generating ""order of magnitude"" estimates for the costs of implementation of a screening programme for colorectal cancer. As benefit estimates are not yet available, however, no cost-effectiveness analysis can be undertaken at this stage. In general, sensitivity analyses reveal that programme costs are more sensitive to changes in clinical variables, especially detection and compliance rates, than they are to variations in the costs of resource inputs. A screening programme with a more elaborate protocol than that currently employed in the Nottingham trial will entail considerable cost increases.";J Epidemiol Community Health. 1991 Sep.45(3):220-4.;Walker A1, Whynes DK, Chamberlain JO, Hardcastle JD.;1757765;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Colonic Neoplasms/prevention & control*,England,Health Care Costs,Humans,Mass Screening/economics*,Models, Econometric,Occult Blood,Patient Acceptance of Health Care,Rectal Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Sensitivity and Specificity; Early Detection of Cancer, Combined Modality Therapy, Colorectal Neoplasms,Primary Prevention,Early Detection of Cancer;;model valid;0.588"one",Cost-effectiveness analysis of screening for colorectal cancer in Japan.;Abstract To clarify the best cost-effective screening strategy for colorectal cancer in Japan, the cost-effectiveness ratio was compared among six currently performed procedures. The analysis was made using a simulation model to estimate long-term cost and effectiveness of the screening programs. In the screening by the immunological fecal occult blood test (FOBT), a comparison between the one- and two-day fecal collection methods indicated that the latter was more cost-effective than the former. A comparison was also made on the four workup methods: barium enema (BE) alone, a combination of BE and sigmoidoscopy (BE + SIG), total colonoscopy (TCF) alone, and a combination of BE and TCF (BE + TCF). The cost-effectiveness ratio was the lowest in the method using TCF alone, followed by those based on BE alone and BE + TCF, and the highest in the BE + SIG method. The superiority of TCF alone strategy was stable over a range of estimates such as the sensitivity of diagnostic tests, the probability of complications due to TCF, etc. It is concluded that a combination of the two-day FOBT and TCF yields the best cost-effectiveness.;Tohoku J Exp Med. 1991 Aug.164(4):269-78.;Tsuji I1, Fukao A, Shoji T, Kuwajima I, Sugawara N, Hisamichi S.;1746016;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Barium Sulfate,Colonic Neoplasms/diagnosis,Colonic Neoplasms/mortality,Colonic Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Colonoscopy/economics,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Enema,Female,Humans,Japan,Male,Mass Screening/economics*,Occult Blood,Rectal Neoplasms/diagnosis,Rectal Neoplasms/mortality,Rectal Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Sigmoidoscopy/economics,Specimen Handling,Barium Sulfate;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Colorectal Neoplasms;;model valid;0.528"one",[The screening model for early diagnosis of colorectal cancer in general population].;Abstract In this study, 75,813 asymptomatic individuals above 30 in Jiashan County of Zhejiang Province were recruited in the screening program.

Without screening, a 50-year-old person at average risk has approximately a 530-in-10,000 chance of developing invasive colorectal cancer in the rest of his or her life and approximately a 250-in-10,000 chance of dying from it. Analysis of indirect evidence with a mathematic model indicates that screening persons for 25 years, from the age of 50 to the age of 75 years should reduce the chance of developing or dying from colorectal cancer by 10% to 75%, depending on which screening tests are used and how often screening is done. Screening for colorectal cancer is optional. A possible recommendation is that annual fecal occult blood tests and 65-cm flexible sigmoidoscopy every 3 to 5 years be done for average-risk men and women who are between 50 and 75 years of age. In addition to having annual fecal occult blood tests, persons with first-degree relatives with colorectal cancer can be offered barium enemas instead of sigmoidoscopies every 3 to 5 years.;Ann Intern Med. 1990 Sep 1.113(5):373-84.;Eddy DM1.;2200321;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Review,Barium Sulfate,Colonoscopy,Colorectal Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Colorectal Neoplasms/prevention & control,Enema,Humans,Mass Screening/economics,Mass Screening/methods*,Models, Statistical,Occult Blood,Risk Factors,Sensitivity and Specificity,Sigmoidoscopy,Barium Sulfate;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Colorectal Neoplasms;valid;model valid;0.34"not valid",Promising Approaches From Behavioral Economics to Improve Patient Lung Cancer Screening Decisions.;Abstract Lung cancer is a devastating disease, the deadliest form of cancer in the world and in the United States. As a consequence of CMS's determination to provide low-dose CT (LDCT) as a covered service for at-risk smokers, LDCT lung cancer screening is now a covered service for many at-risk patients that first requires counseling and shared clinical decision making, including discussions of the risks and benefits of LDCT screening. However, shared decision making fundamentally relies on the premise that with better information, patients will arrive at rational decisions that align with their preferences and values. Evidence from the field of behavioral economics offers many contrary viewpoints that take into account patient decision making biases and the role of the shared decision environment that can lead to flawed choices and that are particularly relevant to lung cancer screening and treatment. This article discusses some of the most relevant biases, and suggests incorporating such knowledge into screening and treatment guidelines and shared decision making best practices to increase the likelihood that such efforts will produce their desired objectives to improve survival and quality of life.;J Am Coll Radiol. 2016 Dec.13(12 Pt B):1566-1570. doi: 10.1016/j.jacr.2016.09.004.;Barnes AJ1, Groskaufmanis L2, Thomson NB 3rd3.;27888943;Review,Clinical Decision-Making/methods*,Decision Making*,Early Detection of Cancer/standards*,Humans,Lung Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Lung Neoplasms/prevention & control,Models, Economic,Patient Participation/methods*,Practice Guidelines as Topic*,Quality Improvement/organization & administration*,United States;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Lung Neoplasms;;model valid;0.204"not valid",Translation of research results to simple estimates of the likely effect of a lung cancer screening programme in the United Kingdom.;Abstract BACKGROUND: There is considerable interest in the possibility of provision of lung cancer screening services in many developed countries. There is, however, no consensus on the target population or optimal screening regimen. METHODS: In this paper, we demonstrate the use of published results on lung cancer screening and natural history parameters to estimate the likely effects of annual and biennial screening programmes in different risk populations, in terms of deaths prevented and of human costs, including screening episodes, further investigation rates and overdiagnosis. RESULTS: Annual screening with the UK Lung Screening Study eligibility criteria was estimated to result in 956 lung cancer deaths prevented and 457 overdiagnosed cancers from 330,000 screening episodes. Biennial screening would result in 802 lung cancer deaths prevented and 383 overdiagnosed cancers for 180,000 screening episodes. INTERPRETATION/CONCLUSION: The predictions suggest that the intervention effect could justify the human costs. The evidence base for low-dose CT screening for lung cancer pertains almost entirely to annual screening. The benefit of biennial screening is subject to additional uncertainty but the issue merits further empirical research.;Br J Cancer. 2014 Apr 2.110(7):1834-40. doi: 10.1038/bjc.2014.63.

Discussion has shifted from clinical proof to financial feasibility. The goal of this study was to determine whether LDCT screening for lung cancer in a commercially-insured population (aged 50-64) at high risk for lung cancer is cost-effective and to quantify the additional benefits of incorporating smoking cessation interventions in a lung cancer screening program. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The current study builds upon a previous simulation model to estimate the cost-utility of annual, repeated LDCT screenings over 15 years in a high risk hypothetical cohort of 18 million adults between age 50 and 64 with 30+ pack-years of smoking history. In the base case, the lung cancer screening intervention cost $27.8 billion over 15 years and yielded 985,284 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained for a cost-utility ratio of $28,240 per QALY gained. Adding smoking cessation to these annual screenings resulted in increases in both the costs and QALYs saved, reflected in cost-utility ratios ranging from $16,198 per QALY gained to $23,185 per QALY gained. Annual LDCT lung cancer screening in this high risk population remained cost-effective across all sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study indicate that repeat annual lung cancer screening in a high risk cohort of adults aged 50-64 is highly cost-effective. Offering smoking cessation interventions with the annual screening program improved the cost-effectiveness of lung cancer screening between 20% and 45%. The cost-utility ratios estimated in this study were in line with other accepted cancer screening interventions and support inclusion of annual LDCT screening for lung cancer in a high risk population in clinical recommendations.;PLoS One. 2013 Aug 7.8(8):e71379. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0071379.

In this article, the authors provide an estimate of the annual number of lung cancer deaths that can be averted by screening, assuming the screening regimens adopted in the NLST are fully implemented in the United States. METHODS: The annual number of lung cancer deaths that can be averted by screening was estimated as a product of the screening effect, the US population size (obtained from the 2010 US Census data), the prevalence of screening eligibility (estimated using the 2010 National Health Interview Survey [NHIS] data), and the lung cancer mortality rates among screening-eligible populations (estimated using the NHIS data from 2000-2004 and the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey linked mortality files). Analyses were performed separately by sex, age, and smoking status, with Poisson regression analysis used for mortality rate estimation. Uncertainty of the estimates of the number of avertable lung cancer deaths was quantified by simulation. RESULTS: Approximately 8.6 million Americans (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 8.0 million-9.2 million), including 5.2 million men (95% CI, 4.8 million-5.7 million) and 3.4 million women (95% CI, 3.0 million -3.8 million), were eligible for lung cancer screening in 2010. If the screening regimen adopted in the NLST was fully implemented among these screening-eligible US populations, a total of 12,250 (95% CI, 10,170-15,671) lung cancer deaths (8990 deaths in men and 3260 deaths in women) would be averted each year. CONCLUSIONS: The data from the current study indicate that LDCT screening could potentially avert approximately 12,000 lung cancer deaths per year in the United States. Further studies are needed to estimate the number of avertable lung cancer deaths and the cost-effectiveness of LDCT screening under different scenarios of risk, various screening frequencies, and various screening uptake rates.

We used the LCPM to predict numbers of U.S. lung cancer deaths for ages 30-84 between 1975 and 2000 under four scenarios as part of the comparative modeling analysis described in this issue. The LCPM is a comprehensive microsimulation model of lung cancer development, progression, detection, treatment, and survival. Individual-level patient histories are aggregated to estimate cohort or population-level outcomes. Lung cancer states are defined according to underlying disease variables, test results, and clinical events. By simulating detailed clinical procedures, the LCPM can predict benefits and harms attributable to a variety of patient management practices, including annual screening programs. Under the scenario of observed smoking patterns, predicted numbers of deaths from the calibrated LCPM were within 2% of observed over all years (1975-2000). The LCPM estimated that historical tobacco control policies achieved 28.6% (25.2% in men, 30.5% in women) of the potential reduction in U.S. lung cancer deaths had smoking had been eliminated entirely. The hypothetical adoption in 1975 of annual helical CT screening of all persons aged 55-74 with at least 30 pack-years of cigarette exposure to historical tobacco control would have yielded a proportion realized of 39.0% (42.0% in men, 33.3% in women). The adoption of annual screening would have prevented less than half as many lung cancer deaths as the elimination of cigarette smoking.;Risk Anal. 2012 Jul.32 Suppl 1:S117-24. doi: 10.1111/j.1539-6924.2011.01652.x.;McMahon PM1, Kong CY, Johnson BE, Weinstein MC, Weeks JC, Tramontano AC, Cipriano LE, Bouzan C, Gazelle GS.;22882882;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Aged,Calibration,Cohort Studies,Disease Progression,Early Detection of Cancer,Female,Health Policy,Humans,Lung Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Lung Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Male,Massachusetts,Middle Aged,Models, Theoretical,SEER Program,Smoking/adverse effects*,Smoking Cessation,Smoking Prevention,Tobacco Products,K25 CA133141/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,U01 CA152956/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,R01 CA097337/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,R00 CA126147/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,R01 CA97337/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,U01CA152956/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Lung Neoplasms;;model valid;0.292"one",Can a national lung cancer screening program in combination with smoking cessation policies cause an early decrease in tobacco deaths in Italy?;Abstract Objective is to predict smoking attributable deaths (SAD) for lung cancer and all causes in Italy, 2015 to 2040, assuming a yet unimplemented tobacco control policies (TCP) and a national, low-dose, lung cancer, computed tomography (CT) annual screening program (CT screen). A dynamic model describing the evolution of smoking habits was developed to estimate quit rates, 1986 to 2009, and to predict SAD under different scenarios: keeping the status quo. raising cigarette taxes by 20%. implementing cessation treatment policies (funding treatment, setting up an active quitline, promoting counseling among health professionals). introducing a three-round annual CT screen for current and former heavy smokers aged 55 to 74, 70% compliance, 20% lung cancer mortality reduction. combining all the above-mentioned measures. The CT screen brought a 3.0% constant annual reduction in lung cancer SAD and decreased or postponed all-cause SAD by 1.7% annually (a half due to respiratory diseases), relative to the status quo scenario. The effect was noticeable after few years from its introduction. TCP showed a steadily strengthening effect starting from 5 to 10 years after implementation. The lung cancer and all-cause SAD under cessation treatment policies, for instance, were reduced by 8.4% and 12.0% in 2030, respectively, and by 16.1% and 20.0% in 2040. TCP gave a greater effect than CT screen in reducing all-cause SAD because cessation brought about a reduction in smoking-related SAD other than lung cancer and respiratory diseases. Combining TCP and CT screen could bring about an early decrease in lung cancer and respiratory disease SAD due to CT screen, followed by a more substantial drop in all-cause SAD in subsequent decades due to TCP.;Cancer Prev Res (Phila). 2012 Jun.5(6):874-82. doi: 10.1158/1940-6207.CAPR-12-0019.

This study aims to analyze the cost effectiveness of different intervention strategies to reduce radon concentrations in existing German dwellings. The cost effectiveness analysis (CEA) was conducted as a scenario analysis, where each scenario represents a specific regulatory regime. A decision theoretic model was developed, which reflects accepted recommendations for radon screening and mitigation and uses most up-to-date data on radon distribution and relative risks. The model was programmed to account for compliance with respect to the single steps of radon intervention, as well as data on the sensitivity/specificity of radon tests. A societal perspective was adopted to calculate costs and effects. All scenarios were calculated for different action levels. Cost effectiveness was measured in costs per averted case of lung cancer, costs per life year gained and costs per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Univariate and multivariate deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (SA) were performed. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were based on Monte Carlo simulations with 5000 model runs. The results show that legal regulations with mandatory screening and mitigation for indoor radon levels >100 Bq/m(3) are most cost effective. Incremental cost effectiveness compared to the no mitigation base case is 25,181 euro (95% CI: 7371 euro-90,593 euro) per QALY gained. Other intervention strategies focussing primarily on the personal responsibility for screening and/or mitigative actions show considerably worse cost effectiveness ratios. However, targeting radon intervention to radon-prone areas is significantly more cost effective. Most of the uncertainty that surrounds the results can be ascribed to the relative risk of radon exposure. It can be concluded that in the light of international experience a legal regulation requiring radon screening and, if necessary, mitigation is justifiable under the terms of CEA.;J Environ Manage. 2010 Nov.91(11):2263-74. doi: 10.1016/j.jenvman.2010.06.015.;Haucke F1.;20619957;Cost-Benefit Analysis,Decision Support Techniques*,Environmental Exposure/adverse effects,Environmental Exposure/economics*,Environmental Exposure/legislation & jurisprudence,Environmental Monitoring/economics,Environmental Monitoring/legislation & jurisprudence,Environmental Restoration and Remediation/economics*,Environmental Restoration and Remediation/legislation & jurisprudence,Housing/economics*,Housing/legislation & jurisprudence,Humans,Lung Neoplasms/economics,Lung Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Models, Economic*,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,Radon/adverse effects,Radon/economics*,Risk,Radon;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Lung Neoplasms;;model valid;0.624"not valid",Estimating the cumulative risk of a false-positive under a regimen involving various types of cancer screening tests.;Abstract OBJECTIVES: When evaluating screening for the early detection of cancer, it is important to estimate both harms and benefits. One common harm is a false-positive (FP), which is a positive screening result, perhaps followed by an invasive test, with no cancer detected on the diagnostic work-up or within a specified time period. An important goal is to estimate the risk of at least one FP, which we call the cumulative risk of an FP, if persons took a regimen of various screening tests, as is commonly recommended. The estimation is complicated because the data come from a study in which subjects are offered various screening tests in rounds with some missing tests in most subjects. Previous methods for estimating cumulative risk of FPs with a single type of test are not directly applicable, so a new approach was developed. METHODS: The tests were ordered by appearance, where the last test was either the first FP (analogous to a failure time) or the last test taken with no FPs having occurred on that test or previously (analogous to a censoring time). We applied a Kaplan-Meier approach for survival analysis with the innovation that the hazard for a first FP for a given test depends on the type of test and number of previous tests of that type which were taken. RESULTS: The method is illustrated with data from the screening arm of the randomized Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial. With an FP defined as a diagnostic work-up in the absence of cancer (or advanced adenoma) within three years, the probability of at least one FP among 14 tests in men was 60.5% with 95% confidence interval of (59.3%, 61.6%). CONCLUSION: A simple estimate is proposed for the probability of at least one FP if persons took a regimen of multiple screening tests of different types. The methodology is useful for summarizing the burden of multiphasic screening programmes.;J Med Screen. 2008.15(1):18-22. doi: 10.1258/jms.2008.007076.;Baker SG1, Kramer BS.;18416950;False Positive Reactions,Humans,Kaplan-Meier Estimate,Mass Screening/methods*,Mass Screening/standards,Mass Screening/statistics & numerical data,Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Proportional Hazards Models,Risk Factors;Primary Prevention,Prostatic Neoplasms,Lung Neoplasms,Early Detection of Cancer;;model valid;0.376"not valid",An early- and late-stage convolution model for disease natural history.;Abstract The standard convolution model of disease natural history posits an asymptomatic (preclinical) and a symptomatic (clinical) state. An augmented model includes, in both the preclinical and clinical states, an early and late stage of disease. In the case of cancer, the early stage would generally correspond to the organ-confined stages before there is evidence of cancer spread. We compute the number of screen-detected (preclinical) and clinical cases in the early and late stages expected under a given screening program and show how the model can be fit to data from a screening trial using maximum likelihood. We also develop expressions for sojourn time, lead time, and overdiagnosis in the context of the model, where each of the above concepts incorporates disease stage. As an example, we fit the model to data from the Mayo Lung Cancer Screening trial.;Biometrics. 2004 Mar.60(1):191-8.;Pinsky PF1.;15032789;Aged,Biometry,Disease/etiology*,Humans,Likelihood Functions,Lung Neoplasms/epidemiology,Lung Neoplasms/etiology,Male,Markov Chains,Mass Screening,Middle Aged,Models, Biological*,Models, Statistical*,Probability,Smoking/adverse effects,Time Factors;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Lung Neoplasms;;model valid;0.292"not valid",Evaluation of cancer prevention strategies by computerized simulation model: methodological issues.;Abstract A computerized simulation model developed to evaluate the potential impact of primary and secondary prevention is discussed from methodologic perspectives. In the simulation model, named CANSAVE (Cancer Strategy Analysis and Validation of Effect), the natural history of cancer was modeled as a Markovian stochastic process from cancer-free state to death. The lung cancer death rate among Japanese males was projected for 50 years to the year 2041. The simulation showed that the age-adjusted death rate would increase and reach a peak of 166 per 100,000 in 1989 and then decrease to 148 in 2003. It then shows a tendency to increase again, up to 255 in 2028. This change may be attributed to a lower smoking initiation rate among those born in the 1930s. Promotion of mass screening programs exhibits a more prompt effect than antismoking efforts, but the reduction in annual deaths is expected to be only 11%, even if a 100% participation is realized by the year 2000. The reduction in smoking initiation rate, on the other hand, begins to show a visible effect very slowly. It was predicted that a 1% annual reduction in smoking initiation rate would result in a 20% decrease in the number of deaths in 2041. The smoking cessation program is in the middle with regard to promptness. The predicted reductions in lung cancer deaths in 2041 were 13, 47, and 66%, respectively, when the annual smoking cessation rate was increased from 0.46% (present status) to 1, 3, and 5%.

Long-term effects of anti-smoking measures and mass screening on lung cancer deaths were also evaluated. The simulation showed that the age-adjusted lung cancer death rate would increase and reach a peak of 166 per 100,000 in 1989 and then decrease to 148 per 100,000 in 2003. It then shows an increasing tendency again, up to 255 per 100,000 in 2028. The smoking initiation rates estimated from the observed lung cancer death rates showed that the changes in death rates may be attributed to a lower smoking initiation rate among those born in the 1930's. Promotion of mass screening programs is effective more quickly than anti-smoking measures but the reduction in annual cancer deaths is expected to be only 11%, even if 100% participation is achieved by the year 2000. A reduction in smoking initiation rate, on the other hand, affects lung cancer deaths very slowly. It was predicted that a 1% annual reduction in smoking initiation rate would result in a 20% decrease in the number of lung cancer deaths in 2041. A smoking cessation program is intermediate with regard to promptness. The predicted reductions in lung cancer deaths in 2041 were 13%, 47%, and 66%, respectively, when the annual smoking cessation rate was increased from 0.46% (present status) to 1%, 3%, and 5%.

The natural history of lung cancer was modeled as a Markovian stochastic process from cancer-free to preclinical, clinical, and finally to terminal states. The increase in mortality rate of lung cancer among males aged 75 to 79 years has been the major force of increase in the total number of lung cancer deaths in Japan. The simulation showed that this tendency would continue until the late 1990s, presumably due to the increase in the proportion of ever-smokers in that cohort, who started smoking at an earlier age than did prior generations. It was shown that the number of lung cancer deaths can be reduced either by smoking cessation or screening programs, and that the reduction is proportional to the increase in the annual smoking-cessation rate and to the annual increment in the screening rate. However, only two to three percent reduction of lung cancer deaths in the year 2001 can be expected when the annual smoking-cessation rate is raised from the current value of 0.46 percent to five percent during the period from 1991 to 2000 or when the screening rate is increased by three percent annually for the same period.;Cancer Causes Control. 1991 May.2(3):147-55.;Yamaguchi N1, Tamura Y, Sobue T, Akiba S, Ohtaki M, Baba Y, Mizuno S, Watanabe S.;1873444;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Aged,Computer Simulation*,Humans,Lung Neoplasms/diagnosis,Lung Neoplasms/mortality,Lung Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Male,Mass Screening,Middle Aged,Primary Prevention,Smoking Prevention;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Lung Neoplasms;;model valid;0.248"not valid",Application of Constrained Optimization Methods in Health Services Research: Report 2 of the ISPOR Optimization Methods Emerging Good Practices Task Force.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Constrained optimization methods are already widely used in health care to solve problems that represent traditional applications of operations research methods, such as choosing the optimal location for new facilities or making the most efficient use of operating room capacity. OBJECTIVES: In this paper we illustrate the potential utility of these methods for finding optimal solutions to problems in health care delivery and policy. To do so, we selected three award-winning papers in health care delivery or policy development, reflecting a range of optimization algorithms. Two of the three papers are reviewed using the ISPOR Constrained Optimization Good Practice Checklist, adapted from the framework presented in the initial Optimization Task Force Report. The first case study illustrates application of linear programming to determine the optimal mix of screening and vaccination strategies for the prevention of cervical cancer. The second case illustrates application of the Markov Decision Process to find the optimal strategy for treating type 2 diabetes patients for hypercholesterolemia using statins. The third paper (described in Appendix 1) is used as an educational tool. The goal is to describe the characteristics of a radiation therapy optimization problem and then invite the reader to formulate the mathematical model for solving it. This example is particularly interesting because it lends itself to a range of possible models, including linear, nonlinear, and mixed-integer programming formulations. From the case studies presented, we hope the reader will develop an appreciation for the wide range of problem types that can be addressed with constrained optimization methods, as well as the variety of methods available. CONCLUSIONS: Constrained optimization methods are informative in providing insights to decision makers about optimal target solutions and the magnitude of the loss of benefit or increased costs associated with the ultimate clinical decision or policy choice. Failing to identify a mathematically superior or optimal solution represents a missed opportunity to improve economic efficiency in the delivery of care and clinical outcomes for patients. The ISPOR Optimization Methods Emerging Good Practices Task Force's first report provided an introduction to constrained optimization methods to solve important clinical and health policy problems. This report also outlined the relationship of constrained optimization methods relative to traditional health economic modeling, graphically illustrated a simple formulation, and identified some of the major variants of constrained optimization models, such as linear programming, dynamic programming, integer programming, and stochastic programming. The second report illustrates the application of constrained optimization methods in health care decision making using three case studies. The studies focus on determining optimal screening and vaccination strategies for cervical cancer, optimal statin start times for diabetes, and an educational case to invite the reader to formulate radiation therapy optimization problems. These illustrate a wide range of problem types that can be addressed with constrained optimization methods. Copyright � 2018 ISPOR�The Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes Research.

Newer technologies may facilitate a same-day screen-and-treat approach, but these testing systems are generally too expensive for widespread use in low-resource settings. METHODS: To assess the value of a hypothetical point-of-care HPV test, we used a mathematical simulation model of the natural history of HPV and data from the START-UP multi-site demonstration project to estimate the health benefits and costs associated with a shift from a 2-visit approach (requiring a return visit for treatment) to 1-visit HPV testing (i.e., screen-and-treat). We estimated the incremental net monetary benefit (INMB), which represents the maximum additional lifetime cost per woman that could be incurred for a new point-of-care HPV test to be cost-effective, depending on expected loss to follow-up between visits (LTFU) in a given setting. RESULTS: For screening three times in a lifetime at 100% coverage of the target population, when LTFU was 10%, the INMB of the 1-visit relative to the 2-visit approach was I$13 in India, I$36 in Nicaragua, and I$17 in Uganda. If LTFU was 30% or greater, the INMB values for the 1-visit approach in all countries was equivalent to or exceeded total lifetime costs associated with screening three times in a lifetime. At a LTFU level of 70%, the INMB of the 1-visit approach was I$127 in India, I$399 in Nicaragua, and I$121 in Uganda. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that point-of-care technology for cervical cancer screening may be worthy of high investment if linkage to treatment can be assured, particularly in settings where LTFU is high.;BMC Cancer. 2017 Nov 25.17(1):791. doi: 10.1186/s12885-017-3786-3.;Campos NG1, Tsu V2, Jeronimo J3, Mvundura M4, Kim JJ5.;29178896;Computer Simulation,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Developing Countries,Early Detection of Cancer,Female,Health Resources,Humans,Mass Screening,Models, Theoretical*,Monte Carlo Method,Papillomavirus Infections/complications,Papillomavirus Infections/diagnosis*,Papillomavirus Infections/epidemiology,Papillomavirus Infections/virology,Point-of-Care Testing*,Socioeconomic Factors,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/etiology,Cervical Cancer Prevention Project/Gates Foundation/;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.44"one",Effect of Cervical Cancer Screening Programs on Preterm Birth: A Decision and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of age at initiation and interval of cervical cancer screening in women of reproductive age on the risk of future preterm birth and subsequent adverse neonatal outcome relative to maternal life-years gained and cost of both screening and preterm birth. METHODS: In this decision and cost-effectiveness analysis, we compared eight cytology-based screening programs varying in age of onset (21, 24, 25, 27, or 30 years) and screening interval (3 or 5 years) in a fictive cohort of 100,000 women. We used the microsimulation screening analysis model to estimate number of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia diagnoses, large loop excisions of the transformation zone (LLETZs), life-years gained, cervical cancer cases, deaths, and costs of screening and treatment. We used the number of LLETZs to calculate additional preterm births, subsequent neonatal morbidity, mortality, and associated costs. RESULTS: The number of LLETZs per 100,000 women varied from 9,612 for the most intensive screening (every 3 years from age 21 years) to 4,646 for the least intensive screening (every 5 years from age 30 years). Compared with the least intensive program, the most intensive program increased maternal life-years gained by 9% (10,728 compared with 9,839), decreased cervical cancer cases by 67% (52 compared with 158), and cervical cancer deaths by 75% (four compared with 16) at the expense of 250% (158 compared with 45) more preterm births and 320% (four compared with one) more neonatal deaths while increasing total costs by $55 million ($77 compared with $23 million). The number of maternal life-years gained per additional preterm birth varied from 68 to 258 with subsequent total costs per maternal life-years gained of $7,212 and $2,329. CONCLUSION: Cervical cancer screening every 3 years and subsequent treatment in women aged younger than 30 years yield limited life-years but may have substantial perinatal adverse effects. Consequently, women who plan to have children may benefit from a more cautious screening approach, taking into account their risk for both cancer and preterm birth.;Obstet Gynecol. 2017 Dec.130(6):1207-1217. doi: 10.1097/AOG.0000000000002366.;Kamphuis EI1, Naber SK, Danhof NA, Habbema JDF, de Groot CJM, Mol BWJ.;29112652;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Age Factors,Australia,Cervix Uteri/pathology,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Cytodiagnosis/methods,Cytodiagnosis/statistics & numerical data,Early Detection of Cancer*/adverse effects,Early Detection of Cancer*/economics,Early Detection of Cancer*/methods,Efficiency, Organizational,Female,Humans,Infant,Infant Mortality,Life Tables,Netherlands,Pregnancy,Premature Birth*/economics,Premature Birth*/prevention & control,Risk Assessment,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms*/diagnosis,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms*/prevention & control;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.62"not valid",Impact of HPV vaccination: health gains in the Italian female population.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the leading cause of cervical cancer and other malignant and benign neoplastic lesions. HPV vaccination has three potential goals: to prevent transmission, infection, and disease. At present, there are no available data about health consequences of HPV immunization in Italy. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of current HPV vaccination strategy in Italy. METHODS: A multistate morbidity-mortality model was developed to estimate the infection process in a theoretical cohort of Italian women. The Markov process considered nine health states (health, anogenital warts, grade 1 and grade 2/3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, cervical cancer, anal cancer, death due to cervical cancer, anal cancer and other causes), and 26 transition probabilities for each age group. The model was informed with the available data in national and international literature. Effectiveness of immunization was assumed considering a literature review pertaining to models and vaccination coverage rates observed in Italy. Life expectancy (ex), Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs), Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), and attributable risk (AR) were estimated for no intervention (cervical cancer screening) and vaccination strategies scenarios. RESULTS: The model showed that in a cohort of 100,000 Italian women the e0 is equal to 83.1 years. With current HPV vaccination strategy the e0 achieves 83.2 (+0.1) years. When HPV-related diseases are considered altogether, the QALYs increase from 82.7 to 82.9 (+0.2 QALYs) with no intervention and vaccination strategies respectively. DALYs decrease by 0.6 due to vaccination. Finally, AR is equal to 93 and 265 cases per 100,000 women in population and not vaccinated, respectively. CONCLUSION: When mortality due to cervical cancer is considered, HPV vaccination seems to have a low impact on health unit gains in the Italian female population. Conversely, when several HPV-related and cancer morbidity conditions are included, the effect of vaccination becomes quite remarkable.;Popul Health Metr. 2017 Sep 29.15(1):36. doi: 10.1186/s12963-017-0154-0.;Marcellusi A1,2,3.;28962572;Adolescent,Adult,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/prevention & control,Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/virology,Child,Child, Preschool,Condylomata Acuminata/prevention & control,Condylomata Acuminata/virology,Early Detection of Cancer,Female,Humans,Infant,Infant, Newborn,Italy/epidemiology,Life Expectancy,Middle Aged,Outcome Assessment (Health Care)*,Papillomaviridae*,Papillomavirus Infections/mortality,Papillomavirus Infections/prevention & control*,Papillomavirus Infections/virology,Papillomavirus Vaccines*,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/mortality,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/pathology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/virology,Vaccination*,Young Adult,Papillomavirus Vaccines;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.432"one",Cost-effectiveness analysis of different types of human papillomavirus vaccination combined with a cervical cancer screening program in mainland China.;Abstract BACKGROUND: China has a high prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) and a consequently high burden of disease with respect to cervical cancer. The HPV vaccine has proved to be effective in preventing cervical cancer and is now a part of routine immunization programs worldwide. It has also proved to be cost effective. This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of 2-, 4-, and 9-valent HPV vaccines (hereafter, HPV2, 4 or 9) combined with current screening strategies in China. METHODS: A Markov model was developed for a cohort of 100,000 HPV-free girls to simulate the natural history to HPV infection. Three recommended screening methods (1. liquid-based cytology test + HPV DNA test. 2. pap smear cytology test + HPV DNA test. 3. visual inspection with acetic acid) and three types of HPV vaccination program (HPV2/4/9) were incorporated into 15 intervention options, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated to determine the dominant strategies. Costs, transition probabilities and utilities were obtained from a review of the literature and national databases. One-way sensitivity analyses and threshold analyses were performed for key variables in different vaccination scenarios. RESULTS: HPV9 combined with screening showed the highest health impact in terms of reducing HPV-related diseases and increasing the number of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Under the current thresholds of willingness to pay (WTP, 3 times the per capita GDP or USD$ 23,880), HPV4/9 proved highly cost effective, while HPV2 combined with screening cost more and was less cost effective. Only when screening coverage increased to 60% ~ 70% did the HPV2 and screening combination strategy become economically feasible. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of the HPV4/9 vaccine with current screening strategies for adolescent girls was highly cost-effective and had a significant impact on reducing the HPV infection-related disease burden in Mainland China.;BMC Infect Dis. 2017 Jul 18.17(1):502. doi: 10.1186/s12879-017-2592-5.;Mo X1,2, Gai Tobe R3, Wang L4, Liu X5, Wu B6, Luo H7, Nagata C8, Mori R2, Nakayama T1.;28720082;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adolescent,Child,China/epidemiology,Cohort Studies,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Female,Humans,Markov Chains,Mass Screening/economics*,Papanicolaou Test,Papillomaviridae,Papillomavirus Infections/economics,Papillomavirus Infections/epidemiology,Papillomavirus Infections/prevention & control*,Papillomavirus Vaccines/economics*,Papillomavirus Vaccines/therapeutic use,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/economics,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Vaccination/economics*,Vaginal Smears,Papillomavirus Vaccines;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.76"one",Evidence-based policy choices for efficient and equitable cervical cancer screening programs in low-resource settings.;Abstract Women in developing countries disproportionately bear the burden of cervical cancer. The availability of prophylactic vaccines against human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18, which cause approximately 70% of cervical cancers, provides reason for optimism as roll-out begins with support from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. However, for the hundreds of millions of women beyond the target age for HPV vaccination, cervical cancer screening to detect and treat precancerous lesions remains the only form of prevention. Here we describe the challenges that confront screening programs in low-resource settings, including (1) optimizing screening test effectiveness. (2) achieving high screening coverage of the target population. and (3) managing screen-positive women. For each of these challenges, we summarize the tradeoffs between resource utilization and programmatic attributes.

METHODS: We used a model-based approach to synthesize population, demographic, and epidemiological data from 50 low- and lower-middle-income countries. Models were used to project the costs (US $), lifetime health impact (cervical cancer cases, deaths averted), and cost-effectiveness (US $ per disability adjusted life year [DALY] averted) of: (1) two-dose HPV-16/18 vaccination of girls aged 10 years. (2) once-in-a-lifetime screening, with treatment when needed, of women aged 35 years with either HPV DNA testing or visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA). and (3) cervical cancer treatment over a 10-year roll-out. RESULTS: We estimated that both HPV vaccination and screening would be very cost-effective, and a comprehensive program could avert 5.2 million cases, 3.7 million deaths, and 22.0 million DALYs over the lifetimes of the intervention cohorts for a total 10-year program cost of US $3.2 billion. CONCLUSION: Investment in HPV vaccination of young girls and cervical cancer screen-and-treat programs in low- and lower-middle-income countries could avert a substantial burden of disease while providing good value for public health dollars. � 2017 The Authors.

DESIGN: A previously developed Monte Carlo simulation model of the natural history of HPV infection and cervical cancer was calibrated to epidemiological data from Nicaragua. Cost data inputs were derived using a micro-costing approach in Carazo, Chontales and Chinandega departments. test performance data were from a demonstration project in Masaya department. SETTING: Nicaragua's public health sector facilities. PARTICIPANTS: Women aged 30-59 years. INTERVENTIONS: Screening strategies included (1) Pap testing every 3 years, with referral to colposcopy for women with an atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance or worse result ('Pap'). (2) HPV testing every 5 years, with referral to cryotherapy for HPV-positive eligible women (HPV cryotherapy or 'HPV-Cryo'). (3) HPV testing every 5 years, with referral to triage with visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) for HPV-positive women ('HPV-VIA'). and (4) HPV testing every 5 years, with referral to Pap testing for HPV-positive women ('HPV-Pap'). OUTCOME MEASURES: Reduction in lifetime risk of cancer and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER. 2015 US$ per year of life saved (YLS)). RESULTS: HPV-based screening strategies were more effective than Pap testing. HPV-Cryo was the least costly and most effective strategy, reducing lifetime cancer risk by 29.5% and outperforming HPV-VIA, HPV-Pap and Pap only, which reduced cancer risk by 19.4%, 12.2% and 10.8%, respectively. With an ICER of US$320/YLS, HPV-Cryo every 5 years would be very cost-effective using a threshold based on Nicaragua's per capita gross domestic product of US$2090. Findings were robust across sensitivity analyses on test performance, coverage, compliance and cost parameters. CONCLUSIONS: HPV testing is very cost-effective compared with Pap testing in Nicaragua, due to higher test sensitivity and the relatively lower number of visits required. Increasing compliance with recommended follow-up will further improve the health benefits and value for public health dollars. � Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2017.

This study aimed at assessing the cost-effectiveness of 3 doses of the bivalent HPV vaccine in rural and urban settings in China. METHODS: A Markov model was adapted to reflect the lifetime of a modelled 100,000 12-year-old girls cohort in rural and urban settings in China. Input parameters were obtained from published literature, official reports and a two-round expert review panel. Clinical and economic outcomes of vaccination at age 12 with screening was compared to screening only. In the base case analysis, a 3 % discount rate, the vaccine cost of 247 CNY (US$ 39, PAHO vaccine cost in 2013), two rounds of screening in a life time and 70 % coverage for both screening and vaccination were used. One-way, two-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. We used different thresholds of cost-effectiveness to reflect the diversity of economic development in China. RESULTS: Vaccination in addition to screening could prevent 60 % more cervical cancer cases and deaths than screening only. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio varied largely when changing cost of vaccination and discount in one way analysis. Vaccination was very cost-effective when the vaccine cost ranged 87-630 CNY (US$ 13.8-100) in rural and 87-750 CNY (US$ 13.8-119) in urban. and remained cost-effective when the vaccine cost ranged 630-1,700 CNY (US$ 100-270) in rural and 750-1,900 CNY (US$ 119-302) in urban in two way analysis. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed that model results were robust. CONCLUSIONS: In both rural and urban, the vaccination cost and discounting are important factors determining the cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination. policy makers in China should take these into account when making a decision on the introduction of HPV vaccine. In areas with a high burden of cervical cancer and limited screening activities, HPV vaccination should be prioritized. However, the vaccine cost needs to be reduced in order to make it very cost-effective and affordable as well, in particular in poverty areas with high disease burden.;BMC Cancer. 2016 Nov 4.16(1):848.;Zhang Q1, Liu YJ1,2, Hu SY1, Zhao FH3.;27814703;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,China/epidemiology,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Health Care Costs,Human papillomavirus 16/immunology*,Human papillomavirus 18/immunology*,Humans,Incidence,Markov Chains,Papillomavirus Infections/epidemiology*,Papillomavirus Infections/prevention & control*,Papillomavirus Vaccines/administration & dosage,Papillomavirus Vaccines/economics,Papillomavirus Vaccines/immunology*,Registries,Vaccination/economics,Papillomavirus Vaccines,R25 TW009340/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.588"not valid",Resources Required for Cervical Cancer Prevention in Low- and Middle-Income Countries.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in women, with 85% of cases and deaths occurring in developing countries. While organized screening programs have reduced cervical cancer incidence in high-income countries through detection and treatment of precancerous lesions, the implementation of organized screening has not been effective in low-resource settings due to lack of infrastructure and limited budgets. Our objective was to estimate the cost of comprehensive primary and secondary cervical cancer prevention in low- and middle-income countries. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We performed a modeling analysis to estimate 1) for girls aged 10 years, the cost of 2-dose human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination. and 2) for women aged 30 to 49 years, the cost of cervical cancer screening (with visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA), HPV testing, or cytology) and preventive treatment in 102 low- and middle-income countries from 2015 to 2024. We used an Excel-based costing and service utilization model to estimate financial costs (2013 US$) based on prevalence of HPV, prevalence of precancerous lesions, and screening test performance. Where epidemiologic data were unavailable, we extrapolated from settings with data using an individual-based microsimulation model of cervical carcinogenesis (calibrated to 20 settings) and multivariate regression. Total HPV vaccination costs ranged from US$8.6 billion to US$24.2 billion for all scenarios considered (immediate, 5-year, or 10-year roll-out. price per dose US$4.55-US$70 by country income level). The total cost of screening and preventive treatment ranged from US$5.1 billion (10-year roll-out, screening once at age 35 years) to US$42.3 billion (immediate roll-out, high intensity screening). Limitations of this analysis include the assumption of standardized protocols by country income level that did not account for the potential presence of multiple screening modalities or management strategies within a country, and extrapolation of cost and epidemiologic data to settings where data were limited. CONCLUSIONS: The estimated cost of comprehensive cervical cancer prevention with 2-dose HPV vaccination of 10-year-old girls and screening of women aged 30 to 49 years ranges from US$13.7 billion to US$66.5 billion, depending on speed of roll-out, vaccine price per dose, and screening test and frequency. Findings demonstrate the substantial impact of vaccine price in middle-income countries that are not eligible for assistance from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. Replacing routine cytology with HPV-based screening may reduce total costs. Data on the health impact and relative cost-effectiveness of strategies are needed to determine the best value for public health dollars.;PLoS One. 2016 Oct 6.11(10):e0164000. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0164000. eCollection 2016.;Campos NG1, Sharma M2, Clark A3, Kim JJ1, Resch SC1.;27711124;Adult,Age Factors,Child,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Developing Countries/economics*,Female,Health Resources/economics*,Health Resources/supply & distribution*,Humans,Mass Screening,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Vaccination;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.564"one",Challenges in Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Modelling of HPV Vaccines in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: A Systematic Review and Practice Recommendations.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) face a number of challenges in implementing cervical cancer prevention programmes that do not apply in high-income countries. OBJECTIVE: This review assessed how context-specific challenges of implementing cervical cancer prevention strategies in LMICs were accounted for in existing cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) models of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination. METHODS: The databases of MEDLINE, EMBASE, NHS Economic Evaluation Database, EconLit, Web of Science, and the Center for the Evaluation of Value and Risk in Health (CEA) Registry were searched for studies published from 2006 to 2015. A descriptive, narrative, and interpretative synthesis of data was undertaken. RESULTS: Of the 33 studies included in the review, the majority acknowledged cost per vaccinated girl (CVG) (26 studies) and vaccine coverage rate (21 studies) as particular challenges for LMICs, while nine studies identified screening coverage rate as a challenge. Most of the studies estimated CVG as a composite of different cost items. However, the basis for the items within this composite cost was unclear. The majority used an assumption rather than an observed rate to represent screening and vaccination coverage rates. CVG, vaccine coverage and screening coverage were shown by some studies through sensitivity analyses to reverse the conclusions regarding cost-effectiveness, thereby significantly affecting policy recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: While many studies recognized aspects of the particular challenges of HPV vaccination in LMICs, greater efforts need to be made in adapting models to account for these challenges. These include adapting costings of HPV vaccine delivery from other countries, learning from the outcomes of cervical cancer screening programmes in the same geographical region, and taking into account the country's previous experience with other vaccination programmes.;Pharmacoeconomics. 2017 Jan.35(1):65-82. doi: 10.1007/s40273-016-0451-7.;Ekwunife OI1,2, O'Mahony JF3, Gerber Grote A4,5, Mosch C6, Paeck T7, Lhachimi SK8,7.;27637758;Review,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Developing Countries,Female,Humans,Mass Screening/economics,Mass Screening/methods,Models, Economic*,Papillomavirus Infections/complications,Papillomavirus Infections/economics,Papillomavirus Infections/prevention & control*,Papillomavirus Vaccines/administration & dosage*,Papillomavirus Vaccines/economics,Research Design,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/economics,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/virology,Papillomavirus Vaccines;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.644"not valid",Industry-academic partnerships: an approach to accelerate innovation.;"Abstract BACKGROUND: Biotechnology companies are process-driven organizations and often struggle with their ability to innovate. Universities, on the other hand, thrive on discovery and variation as a source of innovation. As such, properly structured academic-industry partnerships in medical technology development may enhance and accelerate innovation. Through joint industry-academic efforts, our objective was to develop a technology aimed at global cervical cancer prevention. METHODS: Our Center for Medical Innovation assembled a multidisciplinary team of students, surgical residents, and clinical faculty to enter in the University of Utah's annual Bench-to-Bedside competition. Bench-to-Bedside is a university program centered on medical innovation. Teams are given access to university resources and are provided $500.00 for prototype development. Participation by team members are on a volunteer basis. Our industry partner presented the validated need and business mentorship. The team studied the therapeutic landscape, environmental constraints, and used simulation to understand human factors design and usage requirements. A physical device was manufactured by first creating a digital image (SOLIDWORKS 3D CAD). Then, using a 3-dimensional printer (Stratasys Objet30 Prime 3D printer), the image was translated into a physical object. Tissue burn depth analysis was performed on raw chicken breasts warmed to room temperature. Varying combinations of time and temperature were tested, and burn depth and diameter were measured 30 min after each trial. An arithmetic mean was calculated for each corresponding time and temperature combination. User comprehension of operation and sterilization was tested via a participant validation study. Clinical obstetricians and gynecologists were given explicit instructions on usage details and then asked to operate the device. Participant behaviors and questions were recorded. RESULTS: Our efforts resulted in a functional battery-powered hand-held thermocoagulation prototype in just 72 d. Total cost of development was <$500. Proof of concept trials at 100�C demonstrated an average ablated depth and diameter of 4.7 mm and 23.3 mm, respectively, corresponding to treatment efficacy of all grades of precancerous cervical lesions. User comprehension studies showed variable understanding with respect to operation and sterilization instructions. CONCLUSIONS: Our experience with using industry-academic partnerships as a means to create medical technologies resulted in the rapid production of a low-cost device that could potentially serve as an integral piece of the ""screen-and-treat"" approach to premalignant cervical lesions as outlined by World Health Organization. This case study highlights the impact of accelerating medical advances through industry-academic partnership that leverages their combined resources.

Since many cervical cancers are linked to human papilloma virus (HPV) infection, vaccination against this virus may lead to a reduction in these types of cancer. The study described here is the first to compare the cost-effectiveness of different HPV vaccination options in Lao PDR. METHODS: A dynamic compartment model was created. The model included routine screening activities already in place, as well as theoretical interventions that included a 10-year old girl-only vaccination programme combined with/without a 10-year old boy vaccination programme and/or a catch-up component. The simulation was run over 100 years. In base case analyses, we assumed 70 % vaccination coverage with lifelong protection and 100 % efficacy against HPV types 16/18. The outcomes of interest were the incremental cost per Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) averted. RESULTS: In base case analyses, according to the WHO definition of cost-effectiveness thresholds, vaccinating 10-year-old girls was very cost-effective. Adding a catch-up vaccination element for females aged 11-25 years was also very cost-effective, costing 1559 international dollars (I$) per DALY averted. Increasing the age limit of the catch-up vaccination component to 75 years old showed that this remained a cost-effective option (I$ 5840 per DALY averted). Adding a vaccination programme for 10-year-old boys was not found to be cost-effective unless a short time simulation (30 years or less) was considered, along with a catch-up vaccination component for both males and females. CONCLUSIONS: Adding a catch-up female vaccination component is more attractive than adding a 10-year-old boy vaccination component.;BMC Health Serv Res. 2016 Aug 22.16(1):418. doi: 10.1186/s12913-016-1662-5.;Chanthavilay P1,2, Reinharz D3,4, Mayxay M5,6,7, Phongsavan K8, Marsden DE8, Moore L3, White LJ9,10.;27549921;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adolescent,Adult,Aged,Child,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Female,Humans,Immunization Programs,Laos,Middle Aged,Models, Theoretical,Papillomavirus Infections/economics,Papillomavirus Infections/prevention & control*,Papillomavirus Vaccines/economics*,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Vaccination/economics*,Young Adult,Papillomavirus Vaccines,Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.6"one",Public Health Benefits of Routine Human Papillomavirus Vaccination for Adults in the Netherlands: A Mathematical Modeling Study.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Expanding routine human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination to adults could be an effective strategy to improve prevention of HPV infection and cervical cancer. METHODS: We evaluated the following adult vaccination strategies for women only and for both women and men in addition to the current girls-only vaccination program in the Netherlands, using the established STDSIM microsimulation model: one-time mass campaign, vaccination at the first cervical cancer screening visit, vaccination at sexual health clinics, and combinations of these strategies. RESULTS: The estimated impact of expanding routine vaccination to adult women is modest, with the largest incremental reductions in the incidence of HPV infection occurring when offering vaccination both at the cervical cancer screening visit and during sexually transmitted infection (STI) consultations (about 20% lower after 50 years for both HPV-16 and HPV-18). Adding male vaccination during STI consultations leads to more-substantial incidence reductions: 63% for HPV-16 and 84% for HPV-18. The incremental number needed to vaccinate among women is 5.48, compared with 0.90 for the current vaccination program. CONCLUSIONS: Offering vaccination to adults, especially at cervical cancer screening visits (for women) and during STI consultations (for both sexes), would substantially reduce HPV incidence and would be an efficient policy option to improve HPV prevention and subsequently avert cervical and possibly male HPV-related cancers. � The Author 2016.

As an adjunct to the mainstream program, HPV testing on self-collected samples will be offered under practitioner supervision to all unscreened and underscreened women aged 30-74 years. We quantified how different screening decisions affect the future risk of cervical cancer. DESIGN: Simulation of outcomes for 100 000 previously unscreened women, aged 30 years and eligible for self-collection, using a well-established model of HPV natural history and cervical screening. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cumulative cancer diagnoses and deaths averted (compared with remaining unscreened) to age 84, number needed to treat for pre-cancer (NNT) to avert each cancer diagnosis. RESULTS: One round of self-collected HPV screening at age 30 years would avert 908 cancer diagnoses and 364 cancer deaths in the cohort by age 84 (NNT, 5.8). Benefits would still be achieved were self-collected screening delayed to age 40 (922 fewer diagnoses. 426 fewer deaths. NNT, 3.7) or 50 (684 fewer diagnoses. 385 fewer deaths. NNT, 3.2). However, the benefits associated with joining the mainstream screening program would be substantially larger (2002, 1623 or 1091 fewer diagnoses and NNT of 4.9, 3.7 or 3.4 by joining at age 30, 40 or 50 years respectively). The relative benefits of joining the mainstream program were similar for cohorts who had been offered vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Offering HPV self-collection has the potential to considerably improve outcomes for unscreened and underscreened women. Nevertheless, these findings underscore the need for concerted strategies to encourage these women to join the mainstream HPV screening program.;Med J Aust. 2016 Mar 21.204(5):1941e-7.;Smith M1, Lew JB2, Simms K2, Canfell K2.;26985849;Adult,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Australia,Cause of Death,Female,Humans,Mass Screening/organization & administration*,Middle Aged,Papillomaviridae*,Papillomavirus Infections/diagnosis*,Papillomavirus Infections/mortality,Papillomavirus Infections/prevention & control*,Self-Examination/methods*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Vaginal Smears/methods*,Vulnerable Populations*;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.328"one",Overtreatment and Cost-Effectiveness of the See-and-Treat Strategy for Managing Cervical Precancer.;Abstract BACKGROUND: See-and-treat using loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) has been recommended as an alternative in managing high-grade cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions, but existing literature lacks evidence of the strategy's cost-effectiveness. We evaluated the overtreatment and cost-effectiveness of the see-and-treat strategy compared with usual care. METHODS: We modeled a hypothetical cohort of 40-year-old females who had not been screened for cervical cancer and followed them through their lifetimes using a Markov model. From a U.S. health-system perspective, the analysis was conducted in 2012 dollars and measured effectiveness in quality-adjusted life-years (QALY). We estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) using a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY. The robustness of the see-and-treat strategy's cost-effectiveness and its overtreatment rates were further examined in various sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: In the base-case, the see-and-treat strategy yielded an ICER of $70,774/QALY compared with usual care. For most scenarios in the deterministic sensitivity analysis, this strategy had ICERs larger than $50,000/QALY, and its cost-effectiveness was sensitive to the disutility of LEEP treatment and biopsy-directed treatment adherence under usual care. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that the see-and-treat strategy had a 50.1% chance to be cost-effective. It had an average overtreatment rate of 7.1% and a 78.8% chance to have its overtreatment rate lower than the 10% threshold. CONCLUSION: The see-and-treat strategy induced an acceptable overtreatment rate. Its cost-effectiveness, compared with usual care, was indiscriminating at the chosen willingness-to-pay threshold but much improved when the threshold increased. IMPACT: The see-and-treat strategy was reasonable for particular settings, that is, those with low treatment adherence.

This study aimed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of a 3-dose bivalent HPV vaccination at ages 12 to 55 year in both rural and urban settings in China. METHODS: The Markov cohort model simulated the natural history of HPV infection and included the effect of screening and HPV vaccination over the lifetime of a 100,000 female cohort. Transition probabilities and utilities were obtained from published literature. Cost data were estimated by Delphi panel using healthcare payers' perspective. Vaccine cost was assumed Hong Kong listed price. Vaccine efficacy (VE) was based on the PATRICIA trial data assuming VE irrespective of HPV type at all ages on incident HPV. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3 %. Cervical cancer cases and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for vaccination and screening compared with screening alone were estimated for each vaccination age. Reduced VE in women post-sexual debut were investigated in scenario analyses. RESULTS: With 70 % vaccination coverage, a reduction of cancer cases varying from 585 to 33 in rural and 691 to 32 in urban were estimated at ages 12 to 55, respectively. The discounted ICERs of vaccination at any age under 23 years in rural and any age under 25 years in urban were lower than the current threshold. Scenario analyses with lower VE post-sexual debut confirmed the results with age 20 in rural and 21 in urban had consistent lower ICERs. The more 'catch-up' cohorts vaccinated at the start of a program, the more cancer lesions are avoided in the long-term. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination at any age under 23 years old in rural and any age under 25 years old in urban were cost-effective. Catch-up to the age of 25 years in rural and urban could still be cost-effective.;BMC Cancer. 2016 Feb 26.16:164. doi: 10.1186/s12885-016-2207-3.;Liu YJ1,2, Zhang Q1, Hu SY3, Zhao FH1.;26919850;Adolescent,Adult,Age Factors,Child,China/epidemiology,Cost-Benefit Analysis*,Female,Humans,Markov Chains,Mass Screening,Middle Aged,Outcome Assessment (Health Care),Papillomavirus Vaccines*/administration & dosage,Papillomavirus Vaccines*/immunology,Reproducibility of Results,Rural Population,Urban Population,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Vaccination*,Young Adult,Papillomavirus Vaccines,R25 TW009340/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.604"one",The cost-utility of integrated cervical cancer prevention strategies in the Ontario setting - Can we do better?;Abstract INTRODUCTION: A universal, publicly funded, school-based human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination program in grade eight girls was initiated in Ontario in 2007. We present a cost-utility analysis of integrated cervical cancer prevention programs from the healthcare payer perspective. METHODS: Our analysis was based on linked HPV transmission and disease history models. We obtained data from the literature, provincial surveys and Ontario population-based linked health administrative datasets. We modeled combinations of vaccination and screening strategies. We considered vaccination based on the Ontario experience, as well as conservative and optimistic scenarios, varying coverage, vaccine effectiveness and duration of protection. We considered 900 screening scenarios (screening start age: 21-70 years, screening interval: 3-20 years. 1-year time steps). The current schedule screens every 3 years starting at age 21 years. We examined (1) first vaccinated cohort (low herd-immunity), and (2) steady state, i.e. all cohorts were vaccinated (high herd-immunity). RESULTS: Adding vaccination to the current screening schedule was cost-effective (<C$10,000/quality-adjusted life year (QALY)) across all scenarios. Delaying screening start and/or extending screening intervals increased both expected QALYs and cost, and increased overall NHB for screening schedules with a start age of 25-35 years and 3-10-year intervals for most scenarios. CONCLUSION: Delaying screening start age and/or extending screening intervals in vaccinated cohorts is likely to be cost-effective. Consideration should be given to both the short- and long-term implications of health policy decisions, particularly for infectious disease interventions that require long time intervals to reach steady state.

The Italian recommendations for HPV vaccines consider only females. The BEST II study (Bayesian modelling to assess the Effectiveness of a vaccination Strategy to prevent HPV-related diseases) evaluates 1) the cost-effectiveness of immunization strategies targeting universal vaccination compared with cervical cancer screening and female-only vaccination and 2) the economic impact of immunization on various HPV-induced diseases. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate whether female-only vaccination or universal vaccination is the most cost-effective intervention against HPV. METHODS: We present a dynamic Bayesian Markov model to investigate transmission dynamics in cohorts of females and males in a follow-up period of 55 years. We assumed that quadrivalent vaccination (against HPV 16, 18, 6, and 11) is available for 12-year-old individuals. The model accounts for the progression of subjects across HPV-induced health states (cervical, vaginal, vulvar, anal, penile, and head/neck cancer as well as anogenital warts). The sexual mixing is modeled on the basis of age-, sex-, and sexual behavioral-specific matrices to obtain the dynamic force of infection. RESULTS: In comparison to cervical cancer screening, universal vaccination results in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of �1,500. When universal immunization is compared with female-only vaccination, it is cost-effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of �11,600. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis shows a relatively large amount of parameter uncertainty, which interestingly has, however, no substantial impact on the decision-making process. The intervention being assessed seems to be associated with an attractive cost-effectiveness profile. CONCLUSIONS: Universal HPV vaccination is found to be a cost-effective choice when compared with either cervical cancer screening or female-only vaccination within the Italian context.

This study aims to evaluate the health and economic benefits of HPV vaccination and its combination with different screening strategies to find the most optimal preventive strategy in the Philippines. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was conducted using an existing semi-Markov model to evaluate different screening (i.e., Pap smear, visual inspection with acetic acid) and vaccination strategies against HPV infection implemented alone or as part of a combination strategy at different coverage scenarios. The model was run using country-specific epidemiologic, cost and clinical parameters from a health system perspective. Sensitivity analysis was performed for vaccine efficacy, duration of protection and costs of vaccination, screening and treatment. RESULTS: Across all coverage scenarios, VIA has been shown to be a dominant and cost-saving screening strategy with incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) ranging from dominant to Php 61,059 (1443 USD) per QALY gained. VIA can reduce cervical cancer cases and deaths by 25%. Pap smear screening was found to be not cost-effective due to its high cost in the Philippines. Adding HPV vaccination at a cost of 54 USD per vaccinated girl on top of VIA screening was found to be potentially cost-effective using a threshold of 1 GDP per capita (i.e., Php 120,000 or 2835 USD/ QALY) with the most favorable assumption of providing lifelong immunity against high-risk oncogenic HPV types 16/18. The highest incremental QALY gain was achieved with 80% coverage of the combined strategy of VIA at 35 to 45 years old done every five years following vaccination at 11 years of age with an ICER of Php 33,126 (783 USD). This strategy may result in a two-thirds reduction in cervical cancer burden. HPV vaccination is not cost-effective when vaccine protection lasts for less than 20 years. CONCLUSION: High VIA coverage targeting women aged 35-45 years old at five-year intervals is the most efficient and cost-saving strategy in reducing cervical cancer burden in the Philippines. Adding a vaccination program at high coverage among 11-year-old girls is potentially cost-effective in the Philippines assuming a life-long duration of vaccine efficacy.;BMC Public Health. 2015 Jul 30.15:730. doi: 10.1186/s12889-015-2046-1.;Guerrero AM1, Genuino AJ1, Santillan M2, Praditsitthikorn N3, Chantarastapornchit V4, Teerawattananon Y5, Alejandria M6, Toral JA7.;26223975;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adolescent,Adult,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Early Detection of Cancer/economics,Female,Humans,Managed Care Programs/economics,Middle Aged,Papanicolaou Test/economics,Papillomavirus Infections/economics*,Papillomavirus Infections/prevention & control*,Papillomavirus Vaccines/administration & dosage,Papillomavirus Vaccines/economics*,Philippines/ethnology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/economics*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Vaccination/economics*,Vaccination/statistics & numerical data,Papillomavirus Vaccines;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.744"valid",Projected impact of Cervarix� vaccination on oncogenic human papillomavirus infection and cervical cancer in the United Kingdom.;Abstract We developed a dynamic compartmental model to assess the impact of HPV Universal Mass Vaccination (UMV) with Cervarix�, which offers protection against HPV16/18 and cross-protection against other cancer-causing types, using up-to-date efficacy data. Analyses were performed in the UK because of the large amount of high quality epidemiological data available. For each HPV type/group of types considered, the model was calibrated to 14 epidemiological datasets (prevalence of HPV infection, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN): CIN1, CIN2, CIN3 pre-screening and cervical cancer (CC) incidence over 10 y post-screening). Impacts of cross-protection, female catch-up vaccination, and additional male vaccination on oncogenic infections, high-grade CIN (CIN2+) and CC were evaluated. Our results show that female UMV with 80% coverage and cross-protection against high-risk types resulted in 81% CIN2+ and 88% CC reductions vs. 57% and 75%, respectively, without cross-protection. Vaccinating 40% of males and 80% of females was equivalent to 90% female-only coverage regarding CIN2+ (87% and 87%, respectively) and CC (93% and 94%, respectively) reductions. Female-only coverage of 80% substantially reduced male HPV16 and 18 infection due to herd protection (74% and 89%, respectively). Increasing female coverage to 90% reduced HPV16 and HPV18 infections in males relatively similarly to 80% female combined with 40% male coverage. Model outcomes strengthen previous conclusions about the significant added value of Cervarix� cross-protection for CC prevention, the primary HPV vaccination public health priority. Regarding female CC prevention and male HPV16/18 infection, small increases in female coverage induce similar benefits to those achieved by additionally vaccinating men with 40% coverage.;Hum Vaccin Immunother. 2016.12(1):8-19. doi: 10.1080/21645515.2015.1054584.;Van Effelterre TP1, Hogea C2, Taylor SM1.;26090944;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adolescent,Adult,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/epidemiology*,Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/pathology,Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/prevention & control*,Female,Human papillomavirus 16,Humans,Male,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical,Papillomaviridae/classification*,Papillomaviridae/isolation & purification*,Papillomavirus Infections/complications,Papillomavirus Infections/epidemiology*,Papillomavirus Infections/prevention & control*,Papillomavirus Vaccines/administration & dosage*,Treatment Outcome,United Kingdom/epidemiology,Young Adult,Papillomavirus Vaccines,human papillomavirus vaccine, L1 type 16, 18;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.228"valid",Does it matter?

We conducted an extended cost-effectiveness analysis (ECEA) to evaluate public financing of HPV vaccination to prevent cervical cancer, adding new dimensions to conventional cost-effectiveness analysis through an explicit inclusion of equity and impact on financial risk protection. METHODS: We synthesized available epidemiological, clinical, and economic data from China using an individual-based Monte Carlo simulation model of cervical cancer to estimate the distribution of deaths averted by income quintile, comparing vaccination plus screening against current practice. We also estimated reductions in cervical cancer incidence, net costs to the government (HPV vaccination costs minus cervical cancer treatment costs averted), and patient cost savings, as well as the incremental government health care costs per death averted. RESULTS: HPV vaccination is cost-effective across all income groups when the cost is less than US $50 per vaccinated girl. Compared to screening alone, adding preadolescent HPV vaccination followed by cervical cancer screening in adulthood could reduce cancer by 44 percent across all income groups, while providing relatively higher financial protection to the poorest women. The absolute numbers of cervical cancer deaths averted and the financial risk protection from HPV vaccination are highest among women in the lowest quintile. women in the bottom income quintiles received higher benefits than those in the upper wealth quintiles. Patient cost savings represent a large proportion of poor women's average per capita income, reaching 60 percent among women in the bottom income quintile and declining to 15 percent among women in the wealthiest quintile.

METHODS: We used STDSIM, an established stochastic microsimulation model, quantified to the Netherlands. We explored different assumptions regarding the natural history of HPV-16 and HPV-18, and estimated the transmission probabilities and durations of acquired immunity necessary to reproduce age-specific prevalence. RESULTS: A model without acquired immunity cannot reproduce the age-specific patterns of HPV. Also, it is necessary to assume a high degree of individual variation in the duration of infection and acquired immunity. According to the model estimates, on average 20% of women are immune for HPV-16 and 15% for HPV-18. After an HPV-16 infection, 50% are immune for less than 1 year, whereas 20% exceed 30 years. For HPV-18, up to 12% of the individuals are immune for less than 1 year, and about 50% over 30 years. Almost half of all women will never acquire HPV-16 or HPV-18. CONCLUSIONS: Acquired immunity likely plays a major role in HPV epidemiology, but its duration shows substantial variation. Combined with the lifetime risk, this explains to a large extent why many women will never develop cervical cancer.;PLoS One. 2015 Feb 2.10(2):e0116618. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0116618. eCollection 2015.;Matthijsse SM1, van Rosmalen J2, Hontelez JA1, Bakker R1, de Kok IM1, van Ballegooijen M1, de Vlas SJ1.;25642941;Adaptive Immunity*,Adolescent,Adult,Chlamydia Infections/immunology,Chlamydia Infections/transmission,Female,Human papillomavirus 16/immunology,Human papillomavirus 16/physiology*,Human papillomavirus 18/immunology,Human papillomavirus 18/physiology*,Humans,Male,Middle Aged,Models, Biological*,Papillomavirus Infections/immunology*,Papillomavirus Infections/transmission*,Stochastic Processes,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/immunology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/virology,Young Adult;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.332"one",Health economic analysis of human papillomavirus vaccines in women of Chile: perspective of the health care payer using a Markov model.;Abstract BACKGROUND: In Chile, significant reductions in cervical cancer incidence and mortality have been observed due to implementation of a well-organized screening program. However, it has been suggested that the inclusion of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination for young adolescent women may be the best prospect to further reduce the burden of cervical cancer. This cost-effectiveness study comparing two available HPV vaccines in Chile was performed to support decision making on the implementation of universal HPV vaccination. METHODS: The present analysis used an existing static Markov model to assess the effect of screening and vaccination. This analysis includes the epidemiology of low-risk HPV types allowing for the comparison between the two vaccines (HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine and the HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine), latest cross-protection data on HPV vaccines, treatment costs for cervical cancer, vaccine costs and 6% discounting per the health economic guideline for Chile. RESULTS: Projected incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICERs) for the HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine was 116 United States (US) dollars per quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained or 147 US dollars per life-years (LY) saved, while the projected ICUR/ICER for the HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine was 541 US dollars per QALY gained or 726 US dollars per LY saved. Introduction of any HPV vaccine to the present cervical cancer prevention program of Chile is estimated to be highly cost-effective (below 1X gross domestic product [GDP] per capita, 14278 US dollars). In Chile, the addition of HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine to the existing screening program dominated the addition of HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis results show that the HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine is expected to be dominant and cost-saving in 69.3% and 77.6% of the replicates respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that the addition of any HPV vaccine to the current cervical screening program of Chile will be advantageous. However, this cost-effectiveness model shows that the HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine dominated the HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine. Beyond the context of Chile, the data from this modelling exercise may support healthcare policy and decision-making pertaining to introduction of HPV vaccination in similar resource settings in the region.;BMC Public Health. 2014 Nov 26.14:1222. doi: 10.1186/1471-2458-14-1222.;Gomez JA, Lepetic A1, Demarteau N.;25424716;Adjuvants, Immunologic/economics,Alphapapillomavirus/immunology*,Child,Chile,Cost-Benefit Analysis*,Costs and Cost Analysis,Cross Protection,Female,Health Care Costs*,Human papillomavirus 11/immunology,Human papillomavirus 16/immunology,Human papillomavirus 18/immunology,Human papillomavirus 6/immunology,Humans,Markov Chains,Models, Theoretical,Papillomavirus Infections/economics*,Papillomavirus Infections/prevention & control,Papillomavirus Infections/virology,Papillomavirus Vaccines/economics*,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/economics*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/virology,Vaccination/economics*,Adjuvants, Immunologic,Papillomavirus Vaccines;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.724"one",A systematic review of economic aspects of cervical cancer screening strategies worldwide: discrepancy between economic analysis and policymaking.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Organized cervical screening has decreased the incidence of cervical cancer. However, screening strategies vary in different countries. OBJECTIVES: We performed a systematic review to evaluate the economic aspects of different screening methods. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched databases and then data were abstracted from each study. We evaluated articles based on different types of screening tests as well as screening age and intervals, and using incremental cost effectiveness ratio via calculating quality adjusted life years (QALY), or life years gained (LYG) per cost. We compared the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of each study using GDP per capita. Furthermore, we compared national guidelines with recommendations of cost- effectiveness studies in different countries. RESULTS: A total of 21 articles met our criteria, of which 19 studies showed that HPV DNA testing, 13 suggested an age of 30 years or more, and 10 papers concluded that at least a 5-year or longer interval were the most cost-effective strategies. In some countries, the national guidelines did not match the recommendations of the cost-effectiveness studies. CONCLUSIONS: HPV testing, starting at age 30 years or older and repeated at 5-year or longer intervals, is the most cost-effective strategy in any setting.

METHODS: Model creation: we created presence- absence models for prevention by designating human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination for primary prevention of cervical cancer. Cost classification and cost estimates: we divided the costs of cancer care into seven categories (prevention, mass-screening, curative treatment, palliative care, indirect, non-medical, and psychosocial cost) and estimated costs for each model. Cost-benefit analyses: we performed cost-benefit analyses for Japan as a whole. RESULTS: HPV vaccination was estimated to cost $291.5 million, cervical cancer screening $76.0 million and curative treatment $12.0 million. The loss due to death was $251.0 million and the net benefit was -$128.5 million (negative). CONCLUSION: Cervical cancer prevention was not found to be cost-effective in Japan. While few cost-benefit analyses have been reported in the field of cancer care, these would be essential for Japanese policy determination.;Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2014.15(15):6177-80.;Isshiki T1.;25124594;Adolescent,Adult,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Early Detection of Cancer,Female,Follow-Up Studies,Human papillomavirus 16/isolation & purification,Human papillomavirus 16/pathogenicity,Humans,Models, Economic,Neoplasm Staging,Papillomavirus Infections/economics*,Papillomavirus Infections/prevention & control,Papillomavirus Infections/virology,Papillomavirus Vaccines/economics*,Papillomavirus Vaccines/therapeutic use,Patient Participation,Prognosis,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/economics*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/virology,Vaccination/economics*,Young Adult,Papillomavirus Vaccines;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.52"one",Cost-effectiveness of female human papillomavirus vaccination in 179 countries: a PRIME modelling study.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Introduction of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination in settings with the highest burden of HPV is not universal, partly because of the absence of quantitative estimates of country-specific effects on health and economic costs. We aimed to develop and validate a simple generic model of such effects that could be used and understood in a range of settings with little external support. METHODS: We developed the Papillomavirus Rapid Interface for Modelling and Economics (PRIME) model to assess cost-effectiveness and health effects of vaccination of girls against HPV before sexual debut in terms of burden of cervical cancer and mortality. PRIME models incidence according to proposed vaccine efficacy against HPV 16/18, vaccine coverage, cervical cancer incidence and mortality, and HPV type distribution. It assumes lifelong vaccine protection and no changes to other screening programmes or vaccine uptake. We validated PRIME against existing reports of HPV vaccination cost-effectiveness, projected outcomes for 179 countries (assuming full vaccination of 12-year-old girls), and outcomes for 71 phase 2 GAVI-eligible countries (using vaccine uptake data from the GAVI Alliance). We assessed differences between countries in terms of cost-effectiveness and health effects. FINDINGS: In validation, PRIME reproduced cost-effectiveness conclusions for 24 of 26 countries from 17 published studies, and for all 72 countries in a published study of GAVI-eligible countries. Vaccination of a cohort of 58 million 12-year-old girls in 179 countries prevented 690,000 cases of cervical cancer and 420,000 deaths during their lifetime (mostly in low-income or middle-income countries), at a net cost of US$4 billion. HPV vaccination was very cost effective (with every disability-adjusted life-year averted costing less than the gross domestic product per head) in 156 (87%) of 179 countries. Introduction of the vaccine in countries without national HPV vaccination at present would prevent substantially more cases of cervical cancer than in countries with such programmes, although the disparity has narrowed since 2012. If 71 phase 2 GAVI-eligible countries adopt vaccination according to forecasts, then in 2070 GAVI Alliance-funded vaccination could prevent 200,000 cases of cervical cancer and 100,000 deaths in some of the highest-burden countries. INTERPRETATION: Large between-country disparities exist for HPV vaccination, with countries with the most to gain yet to introduce national HPV vaccination. Support from the GAVI Alliance could help to reduce such disparities, but a substantial burden will remain even after presently projected vaccine introductions.

METHODS: An optimization procedure, using a linear programming approach and requiring the use of two models (an evaluation and an optimization model), was developed. The evaluation model, a Markov model, estimated the annual number of CC cases at steady state in a population of 100,000 women for four alternative strategies: screening only. vaccination only. screening and vaccination. and no prevention. The results of the Markov model for each scenario were used as inputs to the optimization model determining the optimal proportion of the population to receive screening and/or vaccination under different scenarios. The scenarios varied by available budget, maximum screening and vaccination coverage, and overall reachable population. RESULTS: In the base-case optimization model analyses, with a coverage constraint of 20% for one lifetime screening, 95% for vaccination and a budget constraint of $1 per woman per year to minimize CC incidence, the optimal mix of prevention strategies would result in a reduction of CC incidence of 31% (3-dose vaccination available) or 46% (2-dose vaccination available) compared with CC incidence pre-vaccination. With a 3-dose vaccination schedule, the optimal combination of the different strategies across the population would be 20% screening alone, 39% vaccination alone and 41% with no prevention, while with a 2-dose vaccination schedule the optimal combination would be 71% vaccination alone, and 29% with no prevention. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the results are sensitive to the constraints included in the optimization model as well as the cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and CC treatment cost. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the optimization model indicate that, in Nigeria, the most efficient allocation of a limited budget would be to invest in both vaccination and screening with a 3-dose vaccination schedule, and in vaccination alone before implementing a screening program with a 2-dose vaccination schedule.;BMC Cancer. 2014 May 24.14:365. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-14-365.;Demarteau N1, Morhason-Bello IO, Akinwunmi B, Adewole IF.;24885048;Cost-Benefit Analysis*,Female,Humans,Markov Chains,Models, Theoretical*,Nigeria,Papillomaviridae/pathogenicity,Papillomavirus Vaccines/therapeutic use,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/virology,Papillomavirus Vaccines;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.44"one",Cost-effectiveness of cervical cancer prevention in Central and Eastern Europe and Central Asia.;"Abstract We studied the cost-effectiveness of cervical cancer prevention strategies in the Central and Eastern Europe and Central Asia (CEECA) region. The cost-effectiveness of human papillomavirus (HPV)16/18 vaccination of 12 year-old girls was calculated for 28 countries, under the assumption that vaccination prevents 70% of all cervical cancer cases and that cervical cancer and all-cause mortality rates are stable without vaccination. At three-dose vaccination costs of I$ 100 per vaccinated girl (currency 2005 international dollars), HPV16/18 vaccination was very cost-effective in 25 out of 28 countries using the country's gross domestic product (GDP) per capita as cost-effectiveness threshold (criterion by World Health Organization). A three-dose vaccination cost of I$ 100 is within the current range of vaccine costs in European immunization programs, and therefore our results indicate that HPV vaccination may be good value for money. To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of cervical cancer screening combined with vaccination, we calibrated a published simulation model to HPV genotype data collected in Slovenia, Poland, and Georgia. The screening interval was varied at 3, 6, and 10 years starting at age 25 or 30 and ending at age 60. In Slovenia and Poland, combined vaccination and 10-yearly HPV (DNA) screening (vaccination coverage 70%, screening coverage per round 70%) was very cost-effective when the cost of three-dose vaccination was I$ 100 per vaccinated girl. More intensive screening was very cost-effective when the screening coverage per round was 30% or 50%. In Georgia, 10-yearly Pap screening was very cost-effective in unvaccinated women. Vaccination combined with 10-yearly HPV screening was likely to be cost-effective if the three-dose vaccination cost was I$ 50 per vaccinated girl. To conclude, cervical cancer prevention strategies utilizing both HPV16/18 vaccination and HPV screening are very cost-effective in countries with sufficient resources. In low-resource settings, low vaccine pricing is essential for strategies of combined vaccination and screening to be cost-effective.

METHODS: A Markov cohort model was developed to simulate the natural evolution of HPV and its progress to cervical cancer, considering the current preventive programs and treatment costs. The one-year transition probabilities were mainly based on empirical data of local and national studies. The model evaluated the addition of the vaccine to three cervical cancer-screening scenarios (0, 3 or 10 exams throughout life). RESULTS: The scenario of three Pap tests resulted in satisfactory calibration (base case). The addition of HPV vaccination would reduce by 35% the incidence of cervical cancer (70% vaccination coverage). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was US$ 825 for each quality-adjusted life year gained. The sensitivity analysis confirms the robustness of this result, and duration of immunity was the parameter with greater variation in incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. CONCLUSION: Vaccination has a favorable profile in terms of cost-utility, and its inclusion in the immunization schedule would result in a substantial reduction in incidence and mortality of invasive cervical cancer in the Brazilian Amazon region.

METHODS: Three modalities including visual inspection with acetic acid plus Lugol's iodine (VIA/VILI), conventional Pap Smear (Pap Smear), and simple HPV DNA testing (careHPV) were hypothesized for the rural cohort, whereas other five modalities including Pap Smear, liquid-based cytology (LBC), simple HPV DNA testing (careHPV), Hybrid Capture 2 HPV DNA testing (HC2), and LBC plus HC2 (LBC + HC2) were tested for the urban cohort. A Markov model was constructed based on the factors as natural history, screening, diagnosis and treatment on cervical cancer using data related to the epidemics and the costs from rural and urban areas of the country. Long-term effectiveness and cost-effectiveness were predicted through simulation of the model. RESULTS: Compared to the non-screening scenario, the amount of life years saved were 277.97 - 2727.53 and 134.02 - 1446.84 years per 100 000 women, respectively, for different cohorts in rural and urban areas. The cost-effectiveness ratios were 1520.99 - 2453.74 and 3847.35 - 44 570.35 RMB per life year saved, respectively, for different cohorts in rural and urban areas. The incremental cost-effective ratio for careHPV starting from 40 years old (careHPV@40) and careHPV from 30 years old (careHPV@30) dominated other strategies for the rural cohort, while careHPV@40, careHPV@30, HC2 from 30 years old (HC2@30), and LBC + HC2 from 30 years old (LBC + HC2@30) were dominant for the urban cohort. CONCLUSION: All eight once-in-a-lifetime cervical cancer screening modalities were cost-effective based on our model. In particular, careHPV screening starting from 40 years old seemed to be the most cost-effective one for women living in both rural and urban areas.;Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi. 2013 Apr.34(4):399-403.;Xu H1, Zhao FH, Gao XH, Hu SY, Chen JF, Liu ZH, Xu XL, Gao LM, Liu QG, Ma L, Liu YJ, Qiao YL.;23937850;English Abstract,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Age Factors,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Early Detection of Cancer,Female,Humans,Mass Screening/economics*,Middle Aged,Outcome and Process Assessment (Health Care),Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.756"valid",The impact of an imperfect vaccine and pap cytology screening on the transmission of human papillomavirus and occurrence of associated cervical dysplasia and cancer.;Abstract A mathematical model for the natural history of human papillomavirus (HPV) is designed and used to assess the impact of a hypothetical anti-HPV vaccine and Pap cytology screening on the transmission dynamics of HPV in a population. Rigorous qualitative analysis of the model reveals that it undergoes the phenomenon of backward bifurcation. It is shown that the backward bifurcation is caused by the imperfect nature of the HPV vaccine or the HPV-induced and cancer-induced mortality in females. For the case when the disease-induced and cancer-induced mortality is negligible, it is shown that the disease-free equilibrium (i.e., equilibrium in the absence of HPV and associated dysplasia) is globally-asymptotically stable if the associated reproduction number is less than unity. The model has a unique endemic equilibrium when the reproduction threshold exceeds unity. The unique endemic equilibrium is globally-asymptotically stable for a special case, where the associated HPV-induced and cancer-induced mortality is negligible. Numerical simulations of the model, using a reasonable set of parameter values, support the recent recommendations by some medical agencies and organizations in the USA to offer Pap screening on a 3-year basis (rather than annually).

In 2009 a prophylactic vaccine against HPV-type 16 and 18 was implemented in the national immunisation programme to decrease the incidence of cervical cancer. There is evidence that infections with several oncogenic HPV types other than the vaccine types 16 and 18 are also prevented by vaccination, also known as cross-protection. Besides cervical cancer, HPV can also cause cancers at other sites such as the oropharynx, vulva, vagina and the anus/anal area. In this study we estimated the maximum health and economic benefits of vaccinating 12-year old girls against infection with HPV, taking cross-protection and non-cervical cancers into account. In the base-case, we found an incremental cost ratio (ICER) of �5815 per quality adjusted life year (QALY). Robustness of this result was examined in sensitivity analysis. The ICER proved to be most sensitive to vaccine price, discounting rates, costs of cervical cancer and to variation in the disutility of cervical cancer.;Vaccine. 2013 Aug 20.31(37):3922-7. doi: 10.1016/j.vaccine.2013.06.044.

In addition, the economic burden is important for policy formulation. The aim of this study is to estimate patient side cost and to determine predictors of its variation for the treatment of cervical cancer. METHODS: Analytic cross sectional study involving 227 cervical cancer cases at Tikur Anbessa Hospital, Ethiopia was conducted. Cost estimation was based on patients' perspective and using the prevalence-based model as a time frame. Productivity losses were estimated from lost working days. RESULTS: The mean outpatient cost per patient for cervical cancer was $407.2 (Median = $206.9). Direct outpatient cost (Mean = $334.2) takes the largest share compared with the indirect counterpart ($150). The outpatient cost for half of the respondent falls in a range between $93.7 and $478. The mean inpatient cost for hospitalized patients was $404.4. The average direct inpatient cost was $329 (74% medical costs and 26% non medical costs). The mean value for total inpatient cost for half of the respondents was in the range of $133.5 and $493.9. For every additional day of inpatient hospital stay, there is a daily incremental inpatient cost of $4.2. CONCLUSION: As has been found in other studies, our findings revealed that cervical cancer creates an immense financial burden on patients. Primary prevention measures, vaccination against HPV and screening, should be initiated and expanded to reduce morbidity from cervical cancer and subsequent costs in both human lives and money resources. Control of co-morbidity and complication should be emphasized during management of cervical cancer patients. Capacitating regional hospitals and provision of low cost or fee exemption schemes should be arranged and strengthened.;BMC Cancer. 2013 Feb 8.13:69. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-13-69.;Hailu A1, Mariam DH.;23391288;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Absenteeism,Adolescent,Adult,Aged,Ambulatory Care/economics,Cost of Illness*,Cross-Sectional Studies,Ethiopia/epidemiology,Female,Hospital Costs*,Hospitals, Teaching/economics*,Humans,Inpatients,Length of Stay/economics,Linear Models,Middle Aged,Models, Economic,Salaries and Fringe Benefits,Sick Leave/economics,Time Factors,Treatment Outcome,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/economics*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/therapy*,Young Adult;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.356"one",Inclusion of the benefits of enhanced cross-protection against cervical cancer and prevention of genital warts in the cost-effectiveness analysis of human papillomavirus vaccination in the Netherlands.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Infection with HPV 16 and 18, the major causative agents of cervical cancer, can be prevented through vaccination with a bivalent or quadrivalent vaccine. Both vaccines provide cross-protection against HPV-types not included in the vaccines. In particular, the bivalent vaccine provides additional protection against HPV 31, 33, and 45 and the quadrivalent vaccine against HPV31. The quadrivalent vaccine additionally protects against low-risk HPV type 6 and 11, responsible for most cases of genital warts. In this study, we made an analytical comparison of the two vaccines in terms of cost-effectiveness including the additional benefits of cross-protection and protection against genital warts in comparison with a screening-only strategy. METHODS: We used a Markov model, simulating the progression from HPV infection to cervical cancer or genital warts. The model was used to estimate the difference in future costs and health effects of both HPV-vaccines separately. RESULTS: In a cohort of 100,000 women, use of the bivalent or quadrivalent vaccine (both at 50% vaccination coverage) reduces the cervical cancer incidence by 221 and 207 cases, corresponding to ICERs of �17,600/QALY and �18,900/QALY, respectively. It was estimated that the quadrivalent vaccine additionally prevents 4390 cases of genital warts, reducing the ICER to �16,300/QALY. Assuming a comparable willingness to pay for cancer and genital warts prevention, the difference in ICERs could justify a slightly higher price (~7% per dose) in favor of the quadrivalent vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: Clearly, HPV vaccination has been implemented for the prevention of cervical cancer. From this perspective, use of the bivalent HPV vaccine appears to be most effective and cost-effective. Including the benefits of prevention against genital warts, the ICER of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine was found to be slightly more favourable. However, current decision-making on the introduction of HPV is driven by the primary cervical cancer outcome. New vaccine tenders could consider the benefits of cross-protection and the benefits of genital warts, which requires more balanced decision-making.;BMC Infect Dis. 2013 Feb 7.13:75. doi: 10.1186/1471-2334-13-75.;Westra TA1, Stirbu-Wagner I, Dorsman S, Tutuhatunewa ED, de Vrij EL, Nijman HW, Daemen T, Wilschut JC, Postma MJ.;23390964;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Condylomata Acuminata/immunology,Condylomata Acuminata/prevention & control*,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Cross Protection*,Female,Humans,Mass Vaccination/economics*,Models, Economic,Netherlands,Papillomaviridae/classification,Papillomaviridae/immunology,Papillomavirus Vaccines/economics*,Papillomavirus Vaccines/immunology*,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/immunology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/pathology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Papillomavirus Vaccines;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.576"one",Cost-effectiveness of cervical cancer prevention.;Abstract Cost-effectiveness analyses are an important tool for the evaluation and modification of many health care services.

Publicly funded HPV vaccination was introduced in 2007, and partly as a consequence, a renewal of the screening program that includes a review of screening recommendations has recently been announced. This study aimed to provide a baseline for such a review by quantifying screening program resource utilisation and costs in 2010. METHODS: A detailed model of current cervical screening practice in Australia was constructed and we used data from the Victorian Cervical Cytology Registry to model age-specific compliance with screening and follow-up. We applied model-derived rate estimates to the 2010 Australian female population to calculate costs and numbers of colposcopies, biopsies, treatments for precancer and cervical cancers in that year, assuming that the numbers of these procedures were not yet substantially impacted by vaccination. RESULTS: The total cost of the screening program in 2010 (excluding administrative program overheads) was estimated to be A$194.8M. We estimated that a total of 1.7 million primary screening smears costing $96.7M were conducted, a further 188,900 smears costing $10.9M were conducted to follow-up low grade abnormalities, 70,900 colposcopy and 34,100 histological evaluations together costing $21.2M were conducted, and about 18,900 treatments for precancerous lesions were performed (including retreatments), associated with a cost of $45.5M for treatment and post-treatment follow-up. We also estimated that $20.5M was spent on work-up and treatment for approximately 761 women diagnosed with invasive cervical cancer. Overall, an estimated $23 was spent in 2010 for each adult woman in Australia on cervical screening program-related activities. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately half of the total cost of the screening program is spent on delivery of primary screening tests. but the introduction of HPV vaccination, new technologies, increasing the interval and changing the age range of screening is expected to have a substantial impact on this expenditure, as well as having some impact on follow-up and management costs. These estimates provide a benchmark for future assessment of the impact of changes to screening program recommendations to the costs of cervical screening in Australia.;BMC Health Serv Res. 2012 Dec 5.12:446. doi: 10.1186/1472-6963-12-446.;Lew JB1, Howard K, Gertig D, Smith M, Clements M, Nickson C, Shi JF, Dyer S, Lord S, Creighton P, Kang YJ, Tan J, Canfell K.;23216968;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adolescent,Adult,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Cytological Techniques/economics,Cytological Techniques/utilization,Female,Health Resources/economics,Health Resources/utilization,Human papillomavirus 16/isolation & purification,Humans,Immunization Programs/economics,Immunization Programs/organization & administration,Markov Chains,Mass Screening/economics*,Mass Screening/utilization*,Middle Aged,Models, Economic,Registries,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/mortality,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/pathology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Victoria/epidemiology,Young Adult;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.472"not valid",Assessment of a pay-for-performance program in primary care designed by target users.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Evidence for pay-for-performance (P4P) has been searched for in the last decade as financial incentives increased to influence behaviour of health care professionals to improve quality of care. The effectiveness of P4P is inconclusive, though some reviews reported significant effects. OBJECTIVE: To assess changes in performance after introducing a participatory P4P program. DESIGN: An observational study with a pre- and post-measurement. Setting and subjects. Sixty-five general practices in the south of the Netherlands. Intervention. A P4P program designed by target users containing indicators for chronic care, prevention, practice management and patient experience (general practitioner's [GP] functioning and organization of care). Quality indicators were calculated for each practice. A bonus with a maximum of 6890 Euros per 1000 patients was determined by comparing practice performance with a benchmark. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality indicators for clinical care (process and outcome) and patient experience. RESULTS: We included 60 practices. After 1 year, significant improvement was shown for the process indicators for all chronic conditions ranging from +7.9% improvement for cardiovascular risk management to +11.5% for asthma. Five outcome indicators significantly improved as well as patients' experiences with GP's functioning and organization of care. No significant improvements were seen for influenza vaccination rate and the cervical cancer screening uptake. The clinical process and outcome indicators, as well as patient experience indicators were affected by baseline measures. Smaller practices showed more improvement. CONCLUSIONS: A participatory P4P program might stimulate quality improvement in clinical care and improve patient experiences with GP's functioning and the organization of care.;Fam Pract. 2013 Apr.30(2):161-71. doi: 10.1093/fampra/cms055.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the potential healthcare spending changes after the introduction of a HPV16/18 population-wide vaccination programme in Lithuania. STUDY DESIGN: For a cost-effectiveness analysis, we used mathematical simulation and epidemiological data modelling based on a Lithuanian female population. We performed comparative analysis of an annual 12-year-old girls population-wide vaccination programme combined with cervical cancer screening programme compared to the screening programme strategy only. RESULTS: HPV vaccination would gain an average of 35.6 life years per death avoided or up to 284.8 thousand life years would be gained over 90 years in total. The programme costs would be 2932.58 EUR per life year gained. All costs associated with the introduction of the vaccination programme could be recovered in 48 years. The HPV vaccination programme in Lithuania has the potential to generate up to 40.07 million EUR of economic returns annually compared with the current practice of the cervical screening alone. CONCLUSIONS: In Lithuania the HPV16/18 vaccination programme would be economically effective only in the long term. The investment costs of HPV16/18 vaccination have the potential to be recovered.;Scand J Public Health. 2012 Jul.40(5):406-11. doi: 10.1177/1403494812455467.

They include the Netherlands, where both programs are free. To estimate their combined future impact on cancer prevention, information is needed on the association between participation in vaccination now and in screening in the future and on what groups are at risk for nonparticipation. We studied the association between participation in screening by mothers and in vaccination by their daughters. Girls' vaccination status was matched by house-address with their mothers' screening participation. We estimated the effect on cancer incidence by means of computer simulation. We investigated risk groups for nonparticipation using multivariable multilevel logistic regression and calculated population-attributable fractions. Our results, based on 89% of girls invited for vaccination in 2009 (n = 337,368), show that vaccination status was significantly associated with mothers' screening participation (odds ratio: 1.54 [95% confidence interval: 1.51-1.57]). If a mother's screening is taken as proxy of a girl's future screening, only 13% of the girls will not participate in either program compared to 23% if screening alone is available. The positive association between vaccination and screening resulted in slightly lower model estimates of the impact of vaccination on cancer incidence, compared to estimates assuming no association. Girls with nonwestern ethnicities, with young mothers, who live in urban areas with low socioeconomic status, are at risk for nonparticipation. A significant part of potential nonscreeners may be reached through HPV vaccination. Estimates made before vaccination was introduced only slightly overestimated its impact on cervical cancer incidence.;Int J Cancer. 2013 Feb 15.132(4):932-43. doi: 10.1002/ijc.27671.

Using demographic, epidemiological and cancer data, we developed a dynamic individual-based model representing the natural history of HPV/cervical cancer as well as the impact of screening and vaccination programmes. Assuming the current screening strategies, we calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for cohorts with and without vaccination taking into account different combinations of vaccination coverage (50%, 70%, 90%) and cost per vaccinated woman (US$25, US$55, US$125, US$556). The results varied from cost-saving (coverage 50% or 70% and cost per vaccinated woman US$25) to 5950 US$/QALY (coverage 90% and cost per vaccinated 556 US$). In a scenario in which a booster shot was needed after 10 years in order to secure lifelong protection, the ICER resulted in 13,576 US$/QALY. Considering the very cost-effective and cost-effective thresholds based on Brazil's GDP per capita, apart from the booster scenario which would be deemed cost-effective, all the other scenarios would be deemed very cost-effective. Both the cost per dose of vaccine and discount rate (5%) had an important impact on the results. Vaccination in addition to the current screening programme is likely to save years of life and, depending on the cost of vaccination, may even save resources. Price negotiations between governments and manufacturers will be paramount in determining that the vaccine not only represents good value for money, but is also affordable in middle-income countries like Brazil.;Vaccine. 2012 Jul 6.30(32):4866-71. doi: 10.1016/j.vaccine.2012.04.087.

This study evaluates the optimal cervical cancer screening strategy for HIV-infected women in a middle-income country. We developed a mathematical model, which simulates the natural history of the HPV infection, as well as the HIV-mediated immunosupression among women in Brazil. Our model was calibrated using data from the IPEC/FIOCRUZ Women's HIV-infected cohort. The model compares the lifetime effects, costs and cost-effectiveness of strategies combining cytology, HPV DNA test and colposcopy at different screening intervals for different CD4 count strata (27 strategies in total). We found that the strategy with the best cost-effectiveness profile (cost-effectiveness ratio-U$4,911/year of life saved [YLS] and probability of being cost-effective-86%) was HPV testing followed by cytology triage every year for all HIV infected women, considering a very cost-effective threshold given by Brazil's GDP per capita (US$8,625/YLS). The results were robust to changes in the input parameters as demonstrated in one-way, scenario, threshold and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Our study indicates that annual HPV testing followed by cytology triage for all HIV-infected women is likely to be very cost-effective in a middle-income country like Brazil. The results reflect the synergic effect of using a highly sensitive screening test (HPV DNA test) in sequence with a highly specific test (cytology).;Int J Cancer. 2012 Jul 15.131(2):E96-104. doi: 10.1002/ijc.26472.

To investigate the disease cost and then raise awareness of the importance of screening for cervical cancer and promote early detection, this paper employs contingent valuation and willingness to pay (WTP) method to study how health-related quality of life, disease severity, and after-treatment disease status affect patients' WTP for a complete remission of the disease. The inclusive criteria for the study were primary case outpatients at least 3 months after they had received therapy at the time of our study period. Face-to-face interviews were conducted for the retrospective format of the survey. The result of the study indicates a lifetime WTP of $US21 221.96 for Taiwanese cervical cancer patients, which is significantly higher than the cost of screening for early detection. Disease stages do not show a consistent pattern in influencing WTP, but patients with surgery are willing to pay a significantly higher amount for a complete remission from the disease than patients without. In addition, mental health, positive attitudes toward life, and quality of life also are key factors that influence WTP.;Health Econ. 2012 Oct.21(10):1217-33. doi: 10.1002/hec.1786.

Mother's history of cervical cancer screening and daughter's Human Papillomavirus vaccine uptake in Flanders (Belgium).;Abstract OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether and to what extent the uptake of the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine by girls aged 12-18 was related to the cervical cancer screening history of age-appropriate older female household members (assumed to be their mothers) in Flanders (Belgium). METHODS: We studied administrative records on 127,854 female members of the National Alliance of Christian Mutualities, which is the largest health insurance fund in Flanders. Reimbursement data for HPV vaccination of girls for the period 2007-2009 were linked with reimbursement data for cervical cancer screening of their mothers in the three preceding years. A multilevel logit model was used to study associations between both preventive behaviors. In the model we controlled for both the girl's and the mother's age, the province of residence and the socio-economic background of the family. RESULTS: A clear association between a mother's history of participation in cervical cancer screening and her daughter's HPV vaccination initiation was found. The conditional odds of HPV vaccination initiation were more than 4 times higher for girls whose mother had one Pap test than for girls whose mother had none (odds ratio [OR]=4.5. 95% confidence interval [CI]=3.5-5.9). For girls whose mother had three or more Pap tests, the conditional odds were 16 times higher than for girls whose mother did not have any pap tests ([OR]=16.0. 95% [CI]=12.1-21.2). The effect of screening (having received 1 pap smear as compared to none) was larger for girls living in neighborhoods with the lowest median income ([OR]=6.0, 95% [CI]=3.6-10.1). CONCLUSION: In a situation where both cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination are opportunistic, we found evidence that these preventive behaviors cluster within families.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify the optimum mix of interventions that are cost effective, from societal and healthcare provider perspectives, for the prevention and control of cervical cancer. METHODS: A computer-based Markov model of the natural history of cervical cancer was used to simulate an age-stratified cohort of women in Thailand. The strategy comparators, including both control and prevention programmes, were (i) conventional cytology screening (Pap smears). (ii) screening by visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA). and (iii) HPV-16, -18 vaccination. Input parameters (e.g. age-specific incidence of HPV infection, progression and regression of the infection, test performance of screening methods and efficacy of vaccine) were synthesized from a systematic review and meta-analysis. Costs (year 2007 values) and outcomes were evaluated separately, and compared for each combination. The screening strategies were started from the age of 30-40 years and repeated at 5- and 10-year intervals. In addition, HPV vaccines were introduced at age 15-60 years. RESULTS: All of the screening strategies showed certain benefits due to a decreased number of women developing cervical cancer versus 'no intervention'. Moreover, the most cost-effective strategy from the societal perspective was the combination of VIA and sequential Pap smear (i.e., VIA every 5 years for women aged 30-45 years, followed by Pap smear every 5 years for women aged 50-60 years). This strategy was dominant, with a QALY gain of 0.01 and a total cost saving of Baht (Bt) 800, compared with doing nothing. From the societal perspective, universal HPV vaccination for girls aged 15 years without screening resulted in a QALY gain of 0.06 at an additional cost of Bt 8,800, based on the cost of Bt 15,000 for a full immunization schedule. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, comparing HPV vaccinations for girls aged 15 years with the current national policy of Pap smears for women aged 35-60 years every 5 years, was approximately Bt 18,1000 per QALY gained. This figure was relatively high for the Thai setting. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that controlling cervical cancer by increasing the numbers of women accepting the VIA and Pap smear screening as routine and by improving the performance of the existing screening programmes is the most cost-effective policy option in Thailand.;Pharmacoeconomics. 2011 Sep.29(9):781-806. doi: 10.2165/11586560-000000000-00000.;Praditsitthikorn N1, Teerawattananon Y, Tantivess S, Limwattananon S, Riewpaiboon A, Chichareon S, Ieumwananonthachai N, Tangcharoensathien V.;21838332;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Acetic Acid,Adolescent,Adult,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Female,Health Policy/economics*,Humans,Markov Chains,Mass Screening/economics,Mass Screening/methods*,Middle Aged,Models, Economic*,Papanicolaou Test,Papillomavirus Infections/prevention & control,Papillomavirus Infections/virology,Papillomavirus Vaccines/administration & dosage*,Papillomavirus Vaccines/economics,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,Thailand,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/economics,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Vaginal Smears/economics,Vaginal Smears/methods,Young Adult,Papillomavirus Vaccines,Acetic Acid;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.74"valid",Introducing HPV vaccine and scaling up screening procedures to prevent deaths from cervical cancer in Japan: a cost-effectiveness analysis.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of universal vaccination of 11-year-old girls against human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and increased screening coverage to prevent cervical cancer in Japan where the coverage of Papanicolaou smears is very low. DESIGN: A cost-utility analysis from a societal perspective. SETTING: Japan, 2010. POPULATION: The female Japanese population aged 11 years or older. METHODS: A Markov model of the natural history of cervical cancer was constructed to compare six strategies: i.e. a screening coverage rate of 20, 50 and 80% with and without routine vaccination at age 11. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cervical cancer incidence, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: Expanding the coverage of Papanicolaou smears from the current level of 20-50 and 80% yields a 45.5 and 63.1% reduction in cervical cancer incidence, respectively. Impact of combined strategies increases with coverage. Coverages of 20, 50 and 80% showed a 66.1, 80.9 and 86.8% reduction in disease, respectively. The costs of strategies with vaccination are four times higher than the cost of strategies without vaccination. Vaccinating all 11-year-old girls with bivalent vaccines with a Papanicolaou smear coverage rate of 50% is likely to be the most cost-effective option among the six strategies. CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of HPV vaccination in Japan is cost-effective as in other countries. It is more cost-effective to increase the coverage of the Papanicolaou smear along with the universal administration of HPV vaccine. � 2011 The Authors BJOG An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology � 2011 RCOG.;BJOG. 2012 Jan.119(2):177-86. doi: 10.1111/j.1471-0528.2011.03036.x.

METHODS: A lifetime Markov model was constructed with 11 health states covering the progression from human papillomavirus (HPV) infection to the development of precancerous lesions, CC and death. A screening module took into account the effects of detection and early treatment. Cohorts of girls were entered into the model at age 11 years. the model was run for 95 years using one-year cycles. RESULTS: Vaccination combined with screening substantially reduced the incidence of precancerous lesions and CC compared with screening alone. Vaccination was beneficial regardless of age at vaccination, but the greatest benefit was obtained with an early vaccination. The clinical results were the best for vaccination at 11-13 years when lifetime horizon was considered, and for vaccination at 15-17 years for shorter observation period. CONCLUSION: The model results indicate that HPV vaccination offers additional protection against CC when combined with screening.

METHODS: The incidence of cervical cancer was calculated using a Markov model with inputs based on Singapore data for the prevalence of HPV infection, socioeconomic characteristics and screening prevalence. The evaluation was performed for 10 scenarios: no screening, current opportunistic cytology screening, ideal optimal screening, universal adolescent HPV vaccination at 12-years old alone and with catch-up cohorts and combinations of screening and vaccination. RESULTS: (1) The model prediction showed that cervical cancer cases were reduced by 6.5% using opportunistic screening, by 34.3% using optimized screening and by 63.9% with a universal HPV vaccination at 12 years of age. (2) Adding optimized screening, but not opportunistic screening, to a universal adolescent HPV vaccination program caused a moderate further reduction in cervical cancer cases. (3) No difference was discernable in the impact of vaccination introduction between the age groups <20, 20-24 and 25-29 years old. (4) The time required to halve the incidence of cervical cancer was 42 years for universal vaccination at the age of 12 but could be shortened by including catch-up cohorts of women up to 40-years old. CONCLUSION: A universal HPV vaccination program introduced between the ages of 12-29 is superior to cytology screening in reducing the burden of cervical cancer. However, in the next four decades of post-vaccination era, optimizing the screening program remains the most important measure for cervical cancer prevention. � 2011 Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.;Asia Pac J Clin Oncol. 2011 Jun.7(2):154-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1743-7563.2011.01396.x.;Tay K1, Tay SK.;21585695;Adolescent,Adult,Child,Cost of Illness,Female,Humans,Incidence,Markov Chains,Mass Screening/methods*,Papillomavirus Infections/epidemiology,Papillomavirus Infections/prevention & control,Papillomavirus Vaccines/therapeutic use*,Prevalence,Singapore/epidemiology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/virology,Vaginal Smears*,Young Adult,Papillomavirus Vaccines;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.408"not valid",Human papillomavirus vaccine introduction in low-income and middle-income countries: guidance on the use of cost-effectiveness models.;Abstract BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that the cost effectiveness of introducing human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination is considered before such a strategy is implemented. However, developing countries often lack the technical capacity to perform and interpret results of economic appraisals of vaccines. To provide information about the feasibility of using such models in a developing country setting, we evaluated models of HPV vaccination in terms of their capacity, requirements, limitations and comparability. METHODS: A literature review identified six HPV vaccination models suitable for low-income and middle-income country use and representative of the literature in terms of provenance and model structure. Each model was adapted by its developers using standardised data sets representative of two hypothetical developing countries (a low-income country with no screening and a middle-income country with limited screening). Model predictions before and after vaccination of adolescent girls were compared in terms of HPV prevalence and cervical cancer incidence, as was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of vaccination under different scenarios. RESULTS: None of the models perfectly reproduced the standardised data set provided to the model developers. However, they agreed that large decreases in type 16/18 HPV prevalence and cervical cancer incidence are likely to occur following vaccination. Apart from the Thai model (in which vaccine and non-vaccine HPV types were combined), vaccine-type HPV prevalence dropped by 75% to 100%, and vaccine-type cervical cancer incidence dropped by 80% to 100% across the models (averaging over age groups). The most influential factors affecting cost effectiveness were the discount rate, duration of vaccine protection, vaccine price and HPV prevalence. Demographic change, access to treatment and data resolution were found to be key issues to consider for models in developing countries. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated the usefulness of considering results from several models and sets of modelling assumptions in decision making. Modelling groups were prepared to share their models and expertise to work with stakeholders in developing countries.

A cost-effectiveness analysis.;Abstract OBJECTIVES: Italy was the first European nation to offer free vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18. The vaccination is actively encouraged and is available free of charge to 11-year-old girls. The introduction of new technologies such as HPV DNA testing and HPV vaccination requires cost-effectiveness analysis of cervical cancer strategies in Italy for both vaccinated and unvaccinated women. METHODS: A calibrated Markov model was developed to describe the natural history of HPV infection and cervical carcinogenesis. We performed a microsimulation generating the life histories of 10 million women. Changes in these life histories occur as consequences of prevention strategies. We estimated costs of screening activities using an activity-based costing analysis. We assessed lifetime risk due to cervical cancer, lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-expectancy (QALE) for 18 scenarios. Strategies varied by screening interval (three and five years), primary and triage test (Pap test and HPV DNA test), and HPV 16 and 18 vaccination. RESULTS: The current screening policy (Pap test every three years) is more costly and less effective than HPV DNA test and Pap test triage every five years. For unvaccinated women an HPV DNA test every five years with a Pap test triage was cost-effective (ICER �5753/QALE). Vaccination followed by the same screening strategy was cost-effective (ICER �23,951/QALE) for women who are eligible to be vaccinated. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings strongly support changing the Pap screening policy to the use of HPV DNA as a primary test with Pap test triage for both vaccinated and unvaccinated women.;J Med Screen. 2010.17(4):181-9. doi: 10.1258/jms.2010.010019.;Accetta G1, Biggeri A, Carreras G, Lippi G, Carozzi FM, Confortini M, Zappa M, Paci E.;21258128;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Female,Humans,Mass Screening/economics*,Middle Aged,Papillomavirus Infections/diagnosis*,Papillomavirus Infections/immunology,Papillomavirus Vaccines*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/virology,Vaginal Smears/economics*,Papillomavirus Vaccines;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.636"not valid",Costs of cervical cancer screening and treatment using visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) and cryotherapy in Ghana: the importance of scale.;Abstract OBJECTIVES: To estimate the incremental costs of visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) and cryotherapy at cervical cancer screening facilities in Ghana. to explore determinants of costs through modelling. and to estimate national scale-up and annual programme costs. METHODS: Resource-use data were collected at four out of six active VIA screening centres, and unit costs were ascertained to estimate the costs per woman of VIA and cryotherapy. Modelling and sensitivity analysis were used to explore the influence of observed differences between screening facilities on estimated costs and to calculate national costs. RESULTS: Incremental economic costs per woman screened with VIA ranged from 4.93 US$ to 14.75 US$, and costs of cryotherapy were between 47.26 US$ and 84.48 US$ at surveyed facilities. Under base case assumptions, our model estimated the costs of VIA to be 6.12 US$ per woman and those of cryotherapy to be 27.96 US$. Sensitivity analysis showed that the number of women screened per provider and treated per facility was the most important determinants of costs. National annual programme costs were estimated to be between 0.6 and 4.0 million US$ depending on assumed coverage and adopted screening strategy. CONCLUSION: When choosing between different cervical cancer prevention strategies, the feasibility of increasing uptake to achieve economies of scale should be a major concern. � 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.;Trop Med Int Health. 2011 Mar.16(3):379-89. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-3156.2010.02722.x.

The objective of this study was to evaluate vaccination as an alternative or addition to primary HPV screening with careHPV (Qiagen, Gaithersburg, USA), and to assess the threshold total cost per vaccinated girl (CVG) at which strategies involving vaccination would become viable compared to screening-only strategies in rural China. We used data from field studies in Shanxi Province to support modelling of HPV vaccination and screening, including local information on sexual behaviour, HPV prevalence, test accuracy, treatment protocols and costs. We evaluated several strategies involving screening once or twice per lifetime or at regular 5-yearly intervals, with or without vaccination of young females at age 15 years, assuming 70% coverage for both screening and vaccination. We also predicted cross-sectional cancer incidence each year to the year 2050 for a range of strategies. We found that strategies involving vaccination would be cost-effective at CVGs of US$50-54 or less, but at CVGs >$54, screening-only strategies would be more cost-effective. If vaccination of young cohorts is combined with two rounds of careHPV screening for women aged 30-59 years in 2012 and 2027, a predicted indicative 33% reduction in cervical cancer incidence by 2030 would be sustained until 2050, with incidence rates decreasing thereafter. In conclusion, taking into account estimated vaccine delivery costs (for 3 doses), a per-dose HPV vaccine cost of approximately <$9-14 would be required for strategies involving vaccination to be cost-effective.

METHODS: A lifetime Markov cohort model, adapted to the French setting, simulate the natural history of oncogenic HPV infection towards cervical cancer (CC). Additional modules account for the effects of screening and vaccination. The girls' cohort is vaccinated at age 12 and follows current screening. Costs and outcomes (discounted at 3 and 1.5%, respectively) were compared with a cohort receiving screening alone. RESULTS: The model results agreed well with real-life data. Vaccination in addition to screening would substantially reduce the incidence of and mortality from CC, compared with screening alone, at an estimated cost-effectiveness of <euro>9,706 per quality-adjusted-life-year. Sensitivity analysis showed that the discount rate and the parameters related to the disease history have the largest impact on the results. CONCLUSION: This succinct cohort model indicated that HPV vaccination would be a cost-effective policy option in France.

Cervical screening is critical for preventing this type of cancer. Traditionally, screening strategies are evaluated from an economic point of view through cost-effectiveness analysis. However, cost-effectiveness analysis is typically performed on a limited number of de facto or predetermined screening policies. We develop a simulation-optimization model to determine the ages at which screening should be performed, resulting in dynamic, age-based screening policies. We consider three performance measures: cervical cancer incidence, the number of cervical cancer deaths, and the number of life years lost due to cervical cancer death. Using each performance measure, we compare our optimal, dynamic screening strategies to standard policies considered in the health screening literature that are static and predetermined. We also evaluate the anticipated impact of vaccinations for preventing cervical cancer. The strategies that are developed are compared to those used in practice or considered in the literature. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends one screening every 3 years, resulting in 14 scheduled lifetime screenings. Our dynamic screening strategies provide approximately the same health benefits as this but with four to six fewer scheduled screenings, depending on the performance measure considered. Our dynamic strategies also provide approximately the same health benefits as screening every 2 years, but with six to nine fewer scheduled screenings. The results suggest that dynamic, age-based cervical cancer screening policies offer substantial economic savings in order to offer the same health benefits as equally spaced screening strategies.;Health Care Manag Sci. 2010 Dec.13(4):294-318. doi: 10.1007/s10729-010-9131-x.

Several categories of screening program evaluation are of interest, including: (1) changes to screening considered over the short term, over which the effects of vaccination should be confined to the youngest age groups (<30 years old). (2) the medium and long-term effect of vaccination on the screening program. and (3) changes to screening in context of vaccination.

METHODS: We outline some of the specific features of HPV disease and vaccination, and associated policy questions in light of a literature search for economic evaluations on HPV vaccination. RESULTS: We observe that some policy questions could not be reliably addressed by many of the 43 published economic evaluations we found. Despite this, policy making on universal HPV vaccination followed shortly after vaccine licensure in many developed countries, so the role economic evaluation played in informing these decisions (pre-dating 2008) seems to have been fairly limited. For more recent decisions, however, economic evaluation is likely to have been used more widely and more intensively.

Screening is opportunistic (annual/biannual) contributing to social and geographical disparities. METHODS: A multi-HPV-type microsimulation model was calibrated to epidemiologic data from Spain utilising likelihood-based methods to assess the health and economic impact of adding HPV vaccination to cervical cancer screening. Strategies included (1) screening alone of women over age 25, varying frequency (every 1-5 years) and test (cytology, HPV DNA testing). (2) HPV vaccination of 11-year-old girls combined with screening. Outcomes included lifetime cancer risk, life expectancy, lifetime costs, number of clinical procedures and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: After the introduction of HPV vaccination, screening will need to continue, and strategies that incorporated HPV testing are more effective and cost-effective than those with cytology alone. For vaccinated girls, 5-year organised cytology with HPV testing as triage from ages 30 to 65 costs 24,350� per year of life saved (YLS), assuming life-long vaccine immunity against HPV-16/18 by 3 doses with 90% coverage. Unvaccinated girls would benefit from organised cytology screening with HPV testing as triage. 5-year screening from ages 30 to 65 costs 16,060�/YLS and 4-year screening from ages 30 to 85 costs 38,250�/YLS. Interventions would be cost-effective depending on the cost-effectiveness threshold and the vaccine price. CONCLUSIONS: In Spain, inequitable coverage and overuse of cytology make screening programmes inefficient. If high vaccination coverage among pre-adolescent girls is achieved, organised cytology screening with HPV triage starting at ages 30 to at least 65 every 4-5 years represents the best balance between costs and benefits.

METHODS: A previously published Markov model representing natural history of HPV infection was adapted to Slovenian context. The model followed a cohort of 12-year-old girls to 85-year-old women. Two strategies were compared: HPV vaccination alongside conventional cytological screening versus screening alone. Analysis was performed from the health care payer perspective. RESULTS: Vaccination with screening compared with screening alone was associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 23,178 EUR per quality adjusted life-year (QALY) gained and 54,536 EUR per life-year gained (LYG) at the discounting rate of 5%. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the ICER was most sensitive to the need for booster dose and to different values of discount rates. In case the booster dose was assumed 10 years after initial vaccination, the ICER value was increased to 58,690 EUR per QALY. On the other hand, using lower values of discount rates than the base case 5% significantly reduced the ICER value. CONCLUSION: According to the cost-effectiveness thresholds of 30,000 EUR per QALY which was adopted by the Health Council in Slovenia, HPV vaccination alongside screening programme can be regarded as cost-effective. However, cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination would become questionable in case a booster dose was needed to provide lifetime protection.;Eur J Public Health. 2010 Aug.20(4):415-21. doi: 10.1093/eurpub/ckp208.

Two hypothetical HPV vaccines (VA and VB) are compared. At baseline VA provides lifetime protection against HPV-16 and 10-year protection against HPV-18 before waning. VB is the same as VA with a 10-year protection against HPV-6 and 11. Sustained- and cross-protection is varied over wide ranges in VA to define the levels that could make VA cost-effective or dominant compared with VB. RESULTS: Under baseline conditions VB dominates VA. VA becomes cost-effective when the difference in cross-protection alone reaches 13-15% (undiscounted), and 22-44% (discounted). A combination of sustained- and cross-protection is required for VA to dominate VB (discounted). The results are dependent upon country, the base-case value and the discount applied. CONCLUSION: Realistic additional sustained- and cross-protection in one HPV vaccine may confer benefits that offset the economic value of protection against low-risk HPV in the other. The results are country specific.;J Med Econ. 2010.13(2):324-38. doi: 10.3111/13696998.2010.490481.;Demarteau N1, Standaert B.;20504110;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adolescent,Adult,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Child,Condylomata Acuminata/prevention & control*,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Female,Humans,Markov Chains,Middle Aged,Models, Economic*,Papillomavirus Vaccines/economics*,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Young Adult,Papillomavirus Vaccines;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.36"one",Cost effectiveness of prophylactic HPV 16/18 vaccination in Finland: results from a modelling exercise.;Abstract OBJECTIVES: the study aims to estimate the clinical-impact and cost-effectiveness value of adding human papillomavirus 16/18 vaccination against cervical cancer among women currently undergoing organised screening in Finland. METHODS: A Markov cohort model evaluating high-risk HPV infections and cervical cancer (CC) cases combined with screening has been customised to the Finnish setting. The model outcome for a cohort of 30,000 girls aged 10 years was calibrated to age-specific annual number of Pap smears, CC incidence and mortality. RESULTS: The observed age-specific incidence and mortality rates of CC closely match the data replicated by the model. The model predicts that with a 90% vaccine coverage rate, CC cases and mortality would be reduced by 70%. In the base-case analysis with a discount rate of 3% the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) gained, from a healthcare perspective, was �17,294. Without discounting this value is �2,591/QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis suggests that implementing prophylactic CC vaccination within the current screening system would substantially reduce CC cases and deaths, as well as the overall disease burden expressed in pre-cancer lesions averted. Vaccination could be a cost-effective intervention in Finland despite the fact that the number of CC cases and deaths are currently relatively low. Conservative estimates of the cost effectiveness of the vaccination were provided since it was not possible to assess herd protection induced by vaccination using this Markov model.;J Med Econ. 2010.13(2):284-94. doi: 10.3111/13696998.2010.485951.;Torvinen S1, Nieminen P, Lehtinen M, Paavonen J, Demarteau N, Hahl J.;20482244;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Child,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Female,Finland,Humans,Markov Chains,Middle Aged,Models, Economic*,Papanicolaou Test,Papillomavirus Vaccines/administration & dosage*,Papillomavirus Vaccines/economics*,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Vaginal Smears/economics,Vaginal Smears/statistics & numerical data,Papillomavirus Vaccines;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.56"one",Cost-effectiveness analysis of prophylactic cervical cancer vaccination in Japanese women.;Abstract INTRODUCTION: The incidence of cervical cancer (CC) is high in Japan and is further increasing among women younger than 30 years. This burden could be reduced by the implementation of a CC vaccine, but its cost-effectiveness is unknown. METHODS: We quantified the clinical impact and assessed the cost-effectiveness of adding CC vaccination at age 12 to the current screening in place in Japan with a lifetime Markov model adapted to the Japanese setting. Transition probabilities and utility values were obtained from public databases. Direct costs for treatment and screening were estimated using Japanese medical fees. Annual costs and benefits were discounted at 3%. Sensitivity analyses were conducted on the age at vaccination, the vaccine characteristics, the discount rates, the proportion of human papillomavirus types 16/18 in cancer, and the screening coverage. RESULTS: Vaccinating a 12-year-old cohort was predicted to reduce CC incidence and deaths from CC by 73%. These clinical effects were associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of yen1.8 million per quality-adjusted life year gained. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of vaccinating all 10- to 45-year-old women was yen2.8 million per quality-adjusted life year, still below the threshold value. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of a CC vaccination in Japan could reduce the CC burden in a very cost-effective manner for women up to 45 years.;Int J Gynecol Cancer. 2010 Apr.20(3):385-92. doi: 10.1111/IGC.0b013e3181d189b8.;Konno R1, Sasagawa T, Fukuda T, Van Kriekinge G, Demarteau N.;20375802;Adult,Asian Continental Ancestry Group,Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/economics*,Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/prevention & control,Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/virology,Cohort Studies,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Female,Human papillomavirus 16/isolation & purification,Humans,Middle Aged,Models, Economic,Neoplasm Staging,Papillomavirus Infections/complications,Papillomavirus Infections/economics*,Papillomavirus Infections/prevention & control,Papillomavirus Vaccines/administration & dosage,Papillomavirus Vaccines/economics*,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,Sensitivity and Specificity,Survival Rate,Treatment Outcome,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/economics*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/virology,Vaccination/economics*,Vaginal Smears/economics*,Young Adult,Papillomavirus Vaccines;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.64"not valid",Prophylaxis of cervical cancer and related cervical disease: a review of the cost-effectiveness of vaccination against oncogenic HPV types.;"Abstract BACKGROUND: Vaccines have demonstrated cost-effectiveness in managed care through the prevention of disease. As new vaccines for previously untargeted conditions are developed, pharmacoeconomic modeling is becoming even more critical for the quantification of value in the health care industry. Two recently developed vaccines aimed at prevention of infection from human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18 have proven to be highly efficacious. HPV 16 and 18 are the 2 most common oncogenic strains of HPV and are responsible for 70% of cervical cancer cases worldwide. Persistent infection with an oncogenic HPV type is a known cause of cervical cancer. Therefore, prevention of cervical cancer via HPV vaccination may have a significant financial impact. OBJECTIVE: To qualitatively review existing mathematical models of the cost effectiveness of prophylactic HPV vaccination, with an emphasis on the impact on managed care in the United States. METHODS: Mathematical models of the cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination based on U.S. data were reviewed. A search of the PubMed database was conducted using the search terms ""HPV,"" ""vaccine,"" and ""cost-effectiveness"" for articles published before February 22, 2010. Studies employing mathematical models to estimate the cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination in healthy subjects from the United States were included. Models based on data or populations from outside of the United States were excluded. Outcomes were measured with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), typically in units of quality-adjusted life expectancy (quality-adjusted life years [QALYs] gained). Most studies included in this review modeled vaccination of a cohort or population of females aged 12 years. Assessment of catch-up vaccination in females (through aged 24 to 26 years) was included in a couple of reports. One study examined vaccination in older females (aged 35, 40, and 45 years). Models typically compared a strategy of HPV vaccination with the current practice of cervical screening (sampling of cervical cells for disease detection) alone. RESULTS: 11 studies of cost-effectiveness modeling of HPV vaccination were included in this review. A direct quantitative comparison of model results is challenging due to the utilization of different model types as well as differences in variables selected within the same model type. Each model produced a range of cost-effectiveness ratios, dependent on variables included in sensitivity analyses and model assumptions. Sensitivity analyses revealed the lowest ICER to be $997 per QALY gained and the highest ICER to be $12,749,000 per QALY gained. This enormous range highlights the need to clarify what model assumptions are being made. The 2 studies that included modeling of catch-up vaccination scenarios in females older than age 12 years also produced a wide range of ICERs. One study, assuming 90% efficacy, 100% coverage, and lifelong immunity, modeled catch-up vaccination in all females aged 12 to 24 years and yielded an ICER of $4,666 per QALY. If the duration of protection was limited to 10 years, then costs increased to $21,121 per QALY. The other study modeling catch-up HPV vaccination assumed 100% efficacy, 75% coverage, and lifelong immunity. ICERs in this study for outcomes relating to cervical cancer ranged from $43,600 per QALY in the base model vaccinating only 12 year olds with no catch-up vaccination, to $152,700 in a model including catch-up vaccination through age 26 years. Although catch-up to age 21 years resulted in a cost of $120,400 per QALY, the ICER decreased to $101,300 per QALY if model outcomes related to prevention of genital warts were also included. The lone study modeling vaccination in women aged 35 to 45 years resulted in an ICER range of $116,950 to $272,350 per QALY when compared with annual and biennial cytological screening. Cost-effectiveness was defined as an ICER at or below $100,000 per QALY gained. All models of female adolescent vaccination were able to produce vaccination strategies that would be cost-effective according to this definition in addition to many strategies that would be cost-prohibitive. Variables influential in determining cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination included the frequency of accompanying cervical screening, the age at which screening is initiated, vaccination efficacy, duration of vaccine protection, and the age range of females to be vaccinated. The actual effectiveness of HPV vaccination in the female population will also depend on levels of vaccine uptake or coverage and compliance in completing all vaccine doses. CONCLUSION: Clinical studies have shown HPV vaccination to be highly efficacious and potentially lifesaving if administered to females naive or unexposed to vaccine HPV types. Modeling studies have also shown that HPV vaccination can be cost-effective with an ICER of $100,000 or less per QALY gained if administered to females aged 12 years in the context of cervical screening intervals typically greater than 1 year. Catch-up vaccination through 21 years of age increases the cost per QALY to more than $100,000. Until real-world coverage rates increase, cost-effectiveness modeling of HPV vaccination underestimates the actual cost per QALY.";J Manag Care Pharm. 2010 Apr.16(3):217-30.;Armstrong EP1.;20331326;Review,Adolescent,Adult,Age Factors,Child,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Economics, Pharmaceutical,Female,Humans,Managed Care Programs/economics,Middle Aged,Models, Economic*,Papillomavirus Infections/prevention & control,Papillomavirus Infections/virology,Papillomavirus Vaccines/economics*,Papillomavirus Vaccines/immunology,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,United States,Uterine Cervical Diseases/economics,Uterine Cervical Diseases/prevention & control,Uterine Cervical Diseases/virology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/economics,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/virology,Young Adult,Papillomavirus Vaccines;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.704"not valid",Linear trend analysis of patients with cervical cancer treated at the Institute of Oncology Vojvodina in 2001-2007.;Abstract PURPOSE: Cervical cancer is the leading cause of death in women with gynecological cancers in Vojvodina. Serbia currently holds the leading place in Europe regarding the incidence of cervical carcinoma and comes second in terms of mortality. METHODS: Data were retrieved from the Register for malignant neoplasms of the Institute of Oncology Vojvodina for the period 2001-2007. The patients were divided in 3 groups according to the stage of disease based on the FIGO classification for cervical cancer. Data were analysed using linear trend and t-test. RESULTS: The linear trend of the number of registered cases in the group of stage I-IIA patients during 7 years showed no significant change in the prevalence of the disease. In the group of women diagnosed with stage IIB no statistical difference regarding either a rising or a decreasing trend was observed. The observed trend in an advanced disease stage (III and IV) showed a slight decrease in the number of patients, but without statistical significance. CONCLUSION: The linear trend of the number of patients with cervical carcinoma during a 7-year period points to the fact that the number of newly detected cases of advanced disease stages did not decrease significantly despite the affordable and simple methods of early detection. This result underlines the importance of implementation of a National screening programme in the general population for early detection of cervical neoplasms. The excellent results of National screening programmes in other European countries lend support to this approach.;J BUON. 2009 Oct-Dec.14(4):669-72.;Nincic D1, Mandic A, Dugandzija T, Zivaljevic M, Rajovic J, Vojinovic D.;20148460;Adult,Female,Humans,Incidence,Linear Models,Middle Aged,Neoplasm Staging,Prognosis,Registries,Survival Rate,Time Factors,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/pathology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control,Young Adult,Yugoslavia/epidemiology;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.188"one",Effect of type-specific human papillomavirus incidence on screening performance and cost.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Implementation of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination is expected to change the epidemiology of HPV infection. METHODS: Using age-dependent (inhomogeneous) Markov chains, we tested the effect of type-specific (ie, HPV-16/HPV-18 and other high-risk HPV types) HPV incidence on 3 screening strategies in a cohort of 100,000 women, starting screening at the age of 25 years and continuing until the age of 34 years. All the strategies started with an HPV test. if the result was positive, the next step was triage with cytology (strategy 1), cytology and colposcopy together (strategy 2), or colposcopy only (strategy 3). Published background data were used for the models. RESULTS: Strategy 2 had the highest sensitivity. the absolute number of missed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)3+ cases was associated with HPV incidence in all the strategies, but their relative sensitivity remained unaffected. Strategy 2 was cheaper per diagnosed CIN3+ for very low HPV incidence rates, but this changed for higher incidence rates. For any given pair of HPV-16/HPV-18 and other high-risk-type incidence, the cost of the triage and the total cost of screening was highest in screening 2 and lowest in screening 1. For each screening strategy, the cost per diagnosed CIN3+ was mainly determined by the incidence of HPV-16/HPV-18, and the cost of the triage and the total screening cost by the incidence of other high-risk types. CONCLUSIONS: Type-specific HPV incidence affects the absolute number of missed CIN3+ cases and the cost of screening in a mathematically describable way and can be used for prediction of changes in these outcomes with changing HPV epidemiology.;Int J Gynecol Cancer. 2010 Feb.20(2):276-82. doi: 10.1111/IGC.0b013e3181ca5df3.;Agorastos T1, Sotiriadis A, Emmanouilides CJ.;20134270;Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/diagnosis,Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/virology,Female,Human papillomavirus 16*,Human papillomavirus 18*,Humans,Incidence,Markov Chains,Mass Screening/economics*,Models, Theoretical,Papillomavirus Infections/diagnosis*,Papillomavirus Infections/epidemiology*,Papillomavirus Infections/virology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/virology;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.532"one",Transmission dynamic modelling of the impact of human papillomavirus vaccination in the United Kingdom.;Abstract Many countries are considering vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV). However, the long-term impact of vaccination is difficult to predict due to uncertainty about the prevalence of HPV infection, pattern of sexual partnerships, progression of cervical neoplasias, accuracy of screening as well as the duration of infectiousness and immunity. Dynamic models of human papillomavirus (HPV) transmission were developed to describe the infection spread and development of cervical neoplasia, cervical cancer (squamous cell and adenocarcinoma) and anogenital warts. Using different combinations of assumptions, 9900 scenarios were created. Each scenario was then fitted to epidemiological data and the best-fitting scenarios used to predict the impact of vaccination. Results suggest that vaccinating 12-year-old girls at 80% coverage will result in a 38-82% reduction in cervical cancer incidence and 44-100% reduction in anogenital warts incidence after 60 years of an ongoing vaccination programme if vaccine protection lasts 20 years on average. The marginal benefit of vaccinating boys depends on the degree of protection achieved by vaccinating girls.;Vaccine. 2010 May 28.28(24):4091-102. doi: 10.1016/j.vaccine.2009.09.125.

We determined the potential cost-effectiveness of including human papillomavirus tests for cervical cancer screening for Canada and three provinces: Alberta, Newfoundland and Ontario. METHODS: We developed four Markov decision models using data from relevant Canadian and provincial studies and databases. The models were used to determine the number of false positive test results, cancers, lifetime costs and life-expectancy for 27 different screening strategies that varied by age to begin screening (18 or 25 years), screening interval (one, two, three, or five years) and whether the currently recommended strategy (screening every year from age 18 until 21 and then every three years afterwards with conventional Paps) was conducted prior to age 25. Strategies were compared using incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: Screening strategies beginning at age 18 were associated with a substantial increase in the number of false-positive test results but only small differences in the number of cancers compared to the same strategy conducted beginning at age 25. Strategies of human papillomavirus testing first, followed by triage with Pap smears were associated with lower costs and greater increases in life-expectancy than the currently recommended screening strategy in Canada. CONCLUSION: A strategy of human papillomavirus testing beginning at age 25, with Pap triage for women with positive human papillomavirus results may be more effective at reducing cervical cancer at a lower cost than the current recommended strategy for screening in Canada.;BMC Med. 2009 Nov 9.7:69. doi: 10.1186/1741-7015-7-69.;Kulasingam SL1, Rajan R, St Pierre Y, Atwood CV, Myers ER, Franco EL.;19900264;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adolescent,Adult,Alberta,Cervix Uteri/pathology*,Cervix Uteri/virology*,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Female,Humans,Mass Screening/methods*,Newfoundland and Labrador,Ontario,Papanicolaou Test*,Papillomavirus Infections/diagnosis*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/economics*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/virology,Vaginal Smears/economics*,Young Adult,014033/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada,1K07-CA113773/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,83320/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.64"one",A cost-utility analysis of cervical cancer vaccination in preadolescent Canadian females.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Despite the fact that approximately 70% of Canadian women undergo cervical cancer screening at least once every 3 years, approximately 1,300 women were diagnosed with cervical cancer and approximately 380 died from it in 2008. This study estimates the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of vaccinating 12-year old Canadian females with an AS04-adjuvanted cervical cancer vaccine. The indirect effect of vaccination, via herd immunity, is also estimated. METHODS: A 12-health-state 1-year-cycle Markov model was developed to estimate lifetime HPV related events for a cohort of 12-year old females. Annual transition probabilities between health-states were derived from published literature and Canadian population statistics. The model was calibrated using Canadian cancer statistics. From a healthcare perspective, the cost-effectiveness of introducing a vaccine with efficacy against HPV-16/18 and evidence of cross-protection against other oncogenic HPV types was evaluated in a population undergoing current screening practices. The base-case analysis included 70% screening coverage, 75% vaccination coverage, $135/dose for vaccine, and 3% discount rate on future costs and health effects. Conservative herd immunity effects were taken into account by estimated HPV incidence using a mathematical model parameterized by reported age-stratified sexual mixing data. Sensitivity analyses were performed to address parameter uncertainties. RESULTS: Vaccinating 12-year old females (n = 100,000) was estimated to prevent between 390-633 undiscounted cervical cancer cases (reduction of 47%-77%) and 168-275 undiscounted deaths (48%-78%) over their lifetime, depending on whether or not herd immunity and cross-protection against other oncogenic HPV types were included. Vaccination was estimated to cost $18,672-$31,687 per QALY-gained, the lower range representing inclusion of cross-protective efficacy and herd immunity. The cost per QALY-gained was most sensitive to duration of vaccine protection, discount rate, and the correlation between probability of screening and probability of vaccination. CONCLUSION: In the context of current screening patterns, vaccination of 12-year old Canadian females with an ASO4-ajuvanted cervical cancer vaccine is estimated to significantly reduce cervical cancer and mortality, and is a cost-effective option. However, the economic attractiveness of vaccination is impacted by the vaccine's duration of protection and the discount rate used in the analysis.;BMC Public Health. 2009 Oct 31.9:401. doi: 10.1186/1471-2458-9-401.;Anonychuk AM1, Bauch CT, Merid MF, Van Kriekinge G, Demarteau N.;19878578;Canada,Child,Cohort Studies,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Female,Humans,Immunity, Herd,Markov Chains,Models, Economic,Papillomavirus Infections/economics*,Papillomavirus Infections/prevention & control,Papillomavirus Vaccines/economics*,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/economics*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control,Papillomavirus Vaccines;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.684"one",A cost-utility analysis of adding a bivalent or quadrivalent HPV vaccine to the Irish cervical screening programme.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, and in Ireland it is the ninth most commonly diagnosed cancer in women. Almost 100% of these cancers are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Two newly developed vaccines against HPV infection have become available. This study is a cost-utility analysis of the HPV vaccine in Ireland, and it compares the cost-effectiveness profiles of the two vaccines. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis of the HPV vaccine in Ireland was performed using a Markov model. A cohort of screened and vaccinated women was compared with an unvaccinated screened cohort, and both cohorts were followed over their lifetimes. The model looked at uptake of services related to HPV disease in both cohorts. Outcomes were measured in quality adjusted life years (QALYs). Extensive sensitivity analysis was done. RESULTS: For the base case analysis, the model showed that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for quadrivalent HPV vaccination would be 25,349 euros/QALY and 30,460 euros/QALY for the bivalent vaccine. The ICER for the quadrivalent vaccine ranged from 2877 euros to 36,548 euros, and for the bivalent from 3399 euros to 45,237 euros. At current prices, the bivalent vaccine would need to be 22% cheaper than the quadrivalent vaccine in order to have equivalent cost effectiveness. CONCLUSION: HPV vaccination has the potential to be very cost effective in Ireland. The quadrivalent vaccine is more cost effective than the bivalent vaccine.;Eur J Public Health. 2010 Apr.20(2):213-9. doi: 10.1093/eurpub/ckp141.

Despite technological and scientific advances that allow an early detection of precancerous lesions and curative treatment of cervical cancer, Mexico and other Latin American countries have only been able to obtain a small decrease in the mortality rates for this kind of cancer. How to implement and sustain effective public health strategies for cervical cancer prevention, such as increasing cytology-based screening program coverage and implementing HPV-DNA testing and vaccination, are important questions. The aim of this study is to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of the introduction of a quadrivalent (HPV 6/11/16/18) HPV vaccine into the public health system and evaluate the epidemiological and economic benefits on prevention of cervical cancer in Mexico. METHODS: A Markov model is used to simulate the natural history of HPV infection in a cohort of Mexican women to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the cervical cancer screening strategy used in Mexico as well as the benefits of other potential strategies such as 1) vaccination only, 2) conventional cytology-based screening program only and 3) vaccination followed by screening. For the strategies that involve screening we have chosen screening intervals of 3 and 5 years. The model produces results that are reasonably close to the epidemiological data related to HPV and cervical cancer in Mexico. RESULTS: The quadrivalent HPV vaccine could reduce the probability of persistent HPV-16/18 infection by at least 60%, which would result in a near-proportional reduction in HPV-16/18-associated invasive cervical cancer and CIN 3. CONCLUSIONS: The strategy of using only vaccination ($45 USD for three doses) as a preventive measure was a very cost-effective strategy in Mexico ($68USD/LYS). The strategy of vaccination with traditional screening of Pap test every 3 years produced higher cost by a lower performance of cervical cytology in Mexico, at a cost of $15,935 USD per life-year. The cost-effectiveness of the vaccination strategy was highly sensitive to age of vaccination, duration of vaccine efficacy, and cost of vaccination. The Mexican model predicts that a quadrivalent HPV vaccine will reduce the incidence of high- and low-risk-associated cervical cancer. A program of vaccination as a preventive strategy is likely cost effective. The results of this study could be of great value in decision-making for the implementation of an HPV vaccine as a public health policy in Mexico provided that the cost of each dose will be, at most, $15 dollars (USD) dollars, combined with HPV testing, the new strategy of national secondary prevention program.;Arch Med Res. 2009 Aug.40(6):503-13. doi: 10.1016/j.arcmed.2009.08.004.;Reynales-Shigematsu LM1, Rodrigues ER, Lazcano-Ponce E.;19853192;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Computer Simulation,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Female,Human papillomavirus 16,Humans,Incidence,Markov Chains,Mexico,Models, Econometric,Models, Statistical,Papillomavirus Vaccines/economics*,Papillomavirus Vaccines/therapeutic use*,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,Vaginal Smears/economics,Papillomavirus Vaccines;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.672"valid",The potential cost-effectiveness of adding a human papillomavirus vaccine to the cervical cancer screening programme in South Africa.;Abstract This study was designed to answer the question of whether a cervical cancer prevention programme that incorporates a human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is potentially more cost-effective than the current strategy of screening alone in South Africa. We developed a static Markov state transition model to describe the screening and management of cervical cancer within the South African context. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of adding HPV vaccination to the screening programme ranged from US $1078 to 1460 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained and US$3320-4495 per life year saved, mainly depending on whether the study was viewed from a health service or a societal perspective. Using discounted costs and benefits, the threshold analysis indicated that a vaccine price reduction of 60% or more would make the vaccine plus screening strategy more cost-effective than the screening only approach. To address the issue of affordability and cost-effectiveness, the pharmaceutical companies need to make a commitment to price reductions.;Vaccine. 2009 Oct 19.27(44):6196-202. doi: 10.1016/j.vaccine.2009.08.004.

Such decisions are increasingly being made with significant input from mathematical and economic models. The demand for modeling has resulted in the publication of numerous mathematical models looking at the cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination. OBJECTIVE: To review published models that have been used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination in developed countries and highlight points of consensus and disagreement in methods and findings. METHODS: This review consists of cost-effectiveness studies published in the peer-reviewed literature before August 2008. RESULTS: Despite variations in methods, modeling studies are producing consistent conclusions: (1) vaccinating young girls against HPV is likely to be cost- effective. (2) vaccinating boys will most likely not be cost- effective in countries that can reach high coverage rates in girls, and (3) results are most sensitive to the duration of vaccine protection. However, results from analyses examining the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of vaccinating boys when coverage rates are low (< or = 80%) and catch-up strategies have reached conflicting conclusions.

We examined the effect on cervical cancer incidence and mortality of adding HPV vaccination to the current Dutch cervical cancer screening situation and calculated the cost-effectiveness. METHODS: Costs and effects were estimated under favorable assumptions (ie, that HPV vaccination provides lifelong protection against 70% of all cervical cancers, has no side effects, and is administered to all women regardless of their risk of cervical cancer) by using the microsimulation screening analysis (MISCAN) model. The impact of changes in the price of vaccination, number of booster vaccinations, vaccination attendance rate, vaccination efficacy, cervical cancer incidence level, and quality-of-life assumptions was investigated in sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Using the current price of euro118 per vaccine dose and with discounting of costs and effects at an annual rate of 3%, adding HPV vaccination to the current Dutch screening situation had a cost-effectiveness ratio of euro53 500 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. The threshold price per vaccine dose at which the cost-effectiveness of vaccination would correspond to an acceptability threshold of euro20 000 per QALY gained was euro40. With the addition of one or more (up to four) booster vaccinations during a lifetime, this threshold price decreased to euro33 for one booster (to euro16 for four boosters). With a doubling of the cervical cancer incidence level, the cost-effectiveness ratio was euro24 400 per QALY gained and the maximum price per dose at threshold of euro20 000 was euro97. All threshold prices were lower under less favorable effectiveness assumptions. CONCLUSIONS: In the Netherlands, HPV vaccination is not cost-effective even under favorable assumptions. To become cost-effective, the vaccine price would have to be decreased considerably, depending on the effectiveness of the vaccine.;J Natl Cancer Inst. 2009 Aug 5.101(15):1083-92. doi: 10.1093/jnci/djp183.

METHOD: Health effects are predicted by a dynamic transmission model. Model results are used to calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) in euro per life year gained (LYG) for a time-horizon between 2008 and 2060 from a public payer and a societal perspective. RESULTS: Vaccination of girls results a discounted ICER of euro 64,000/LYG and euro 50,000/LYG from a payer's and societal perspectives respectively. The additional vaccination of boys increases the ICER to euro 311,000 and euro 299,000/LYG respectively. Results were most sensitive to vaccination price, discount rate and time-horizon. CONCLUSION: HPV-vaccination for girls should be cost-effective when adopting a longer time-horizon and a societal perspective. Applying a shorter time frame and a payer's perspective or vaccinating boys may not be cost-effective without reducing the vaccine price.;Vaccine. 2009 Aug 13.27(37):5133-41. doi: 10.1016/j.vaccine.2009.06.039.

Implementation of an HPV-vaccination strategy targeting the major oncogenic types 16 and 18 that cause cervical cancer is generally expected to significantly reduce the burden of cervical cancer disease. Here we estimate the costs, savings and health gains with the addition of HPV-16/18 vaccination to the already existing Dutch screening programme. In the base-case analysis, it was estimated that implementation of an HPV-16/18 vaccine would result in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of euro22,700 per life-year gained (LYG). In sensitivity analysis, the robustness of our finding of favourable cost-effectiveness was established. The ICER appeared sensitive to the vaccine price, discount rate and duration of vaccine-induced protection. From our results, it validly follows that immunization of 12-year-old Dutch girls against HPV-16/18 infection is a cost-effective strategy for protecting against cervical cancer.;Vaccine. 2009 Jul 30.27(35):4776-83. doi: 10.1016/j.vaccine.2009.05.085.

Answering the question of which age groups are appropriate to target for catch-up vaccination with the newly licensed quadrivalent HPV vaccine (types 6/11/16/18) will be important for developing vaccine policy recommendations. OBJECTIVES: To assess the value of varying female HPV vaccination strategies by specific age groups of a catch-up program in the United States. METHODS: The authors used previously published mathematical population dynamic model and cost-utility analysis to evaluate the public health impact and cost-effectiveness of alternative quadrivalent HPV (6/11/16/18) vaccination strategies. The model simulates heterosexual transmission of HPV infection and occurrence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), cervical cancer, and external genital warts in an age-structured population stratified by sex and sexual activity groups. The cost-utility analysis estimates the cost of vaccination, screening, diagnosis, and treatment of HPV diseases, and quality-adjusted survival. RESULTS: Compared with the current screening practices, vaccinating girls and women ages 12 to 24 years was the most effective strategy, reducing the number of HPV6/11/16/18-related genital warts, CIN grades 2 and 3, and cervical cancer cases among women in the next 25 years by 3,049,285, 1,399,935, and 30,021. respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of this strategy when compared with vaccinating girls and women ages 12 to 19 years was $10,986 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. CONCLUSION.: Relative to other commonly accepted health-care programs, vaccinating girls and women ages 12 to 24 years appears cost-effective.;Value Health. 2009 Jul-Aug.12(5):697-707. doi: 10.1111/j.1524-4733.2009.00512.x.;Elbasha EH1, Dasbach EJ, Insinga RP, Haupt RM, Barr E.;19490561;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adolescent,Adult,Age Factors,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Child,Condylomata Acuminata/economics,Condylomata Acuminata/prevention & control,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Costs and Cost Analysis,Female,Human Papillomavirus Recombinant Vaccine Quadrivalent, Types 6, 11, 16, 18,Humans,Mass Vaccination/economics*,Middle Aged,Models, Econometric,Papillomavirus Infections/economics*,Papillomavirus Infections/prevention & control,Papillomavirus Vaccines/economics*,Papillomavirus Vaccines/therapeutic use,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,United States,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/economics,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control,Young Adult,Human Papillomavirus Recombinant Vaccine Quadrivalent, Types 6, 11, 16, 18,Papillomavirus Vaccines;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.644"one",Estimating the long-term clinical impact of cervical cancer vaccination in Taiwan.;Abstract The high burden of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and subsequent cervical cancer in the presence of screening in Taiwan suggests the need for further prevention strategies. Epidemiology and screening practices vary considerably between countries, and specific analyses are required to estimate the impact of HPV vaccination. This study adapted a computer-based health economic model to Taiwan to project the clinical impact of the introduction of a prophylactic vaccine against persistent HPV 16/18 infection on cervical disease. A Markov model based on the natural history of HPV and cervical cancer was developed to simulate transitions between health states (normal, HPV, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [CIN] stages I to III, cervical cancer stages I to IV, and death) in the presence of screening. The model was calibrated to Taiwan epidemiological end points including age-specific HPV prevalence, prevalence of CIN lesions, and predicted cervical cancer incidence and mortality. Taiwanese screening and treatment practices were modeled, and published clinical trial data were used to estimate vaccine efficacy. With 100% vaccine coverage in a 13-year-old cohort of females, there is estimated to be a 71% reduction in cervical cancer cases and deaths due to all HPV types and substantial reductions in the prevalence of precancerous lesions and screening outcomes. Removing the risk of HPV infection of a large proportion of Taiwanese females, with a high underlying cervical cancer incidence rate, would be expected to have dramatic effects on the health care system and mortality in Taiwan.;Int J Gynecol Cancer. 2009 Feb.19(2):281-8. doi: 10.1111/IGC.0b013e31819c14d6.;Yen MS1, You SL, Ferko N, Debicki D, Chen YC, Chou CY.;19396010;Adult,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Cancer Vaccines/therapeutic use*,Disease Progression,Female,Humans,Markov Chains,Middle Aged,Papillomavirus Infections/complications,Taiwan/epidemiology,Time Factors,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/virology,Cancer Vaccines;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.372"one",Prevention of cervical cancer with screening programme in Branicevo District and cost-effectiveness analysis adjusted to the territory of the Republic of Serbia.;Abstract PURPOSE: To establish the so-called positive screening instead of the current opportunistic screening for cervical cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The program of positive screening covered all female persons aged 30-49 years living in the Branicevo District. All women were sent an invitation to participate in the screening and those who responded had Papanicolaou smear test done on the results of which further diagnostic procedures would be determined. RESULTS: The invitation to examination was responded by 11,200 (48.70%) out of 23,000 women invited. The costs of organized screening per capita amounted to Republic of Serbia dinar (RSD) 380.00 (EUR 4.75). 954 patients in total underwent colposcopy and conization, resulting in RSD total costs of 11,926,373.70 (149,079.00 EUR). Assuming the same incidence rate among the population that did not respond to the invitation, the number of women that would have such an intervention would be increased by 893. CONCLUSION: One-year screening programme is more effective than 3-year programme (180 lives saved compared to 113), but more expensive.

Moreover, the health and economic consequences of a potential decline in screening uptake after initiation of a HPV vaccination program are investigated. METHODS: A static Markov model is developed to estimate the direct effect of vaccination on precancerous lesions and cervical cancers. RESULTS: Vaccination is estimated to avoid 20 percent of the cervical cancers occurring in a 12-year-old girls' cohort and to cost 32,665 euro per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained (95 percent credibility interval [CrI]: 17,447 euro to 68,078 euro), assuming a booster injection after 10 years, a limited duration of protection and discounting costs and effects at 3 percent and 1.5 percent, respectively. Assuming lifelong protection, HPV vaccination is estimated to cost 14,382 euro (95 percent CrI: 9,238 euro to 25,644 euro) per QALY gained, while avoiding 50 percent of the cervical cancer cases. In the base-case, a 10 percent reduction in screening compliance after vaccination obliterates the effect of vaccination on cervical cancer cases avoided, whereas further declines in the level of screening compliance even turned out to be detrimental for the cohort's health, inducing a mean loss in QALYs and life-year gained compared with the situation prevaccination.

Modelling and economic studies have addressed some of those information needs. We conducted a qualitative systematic review to summarize the existing data. Review articles were obtained from an extensive literature search on studies using mathematical modelling (either a Markov or transmission dynamic model) to determine the effectiveness or cost effectiveness of an HPV vaccine compared with the current cytology-based Pap smear screening programme. A total of 21 studies (but 22 models) were included in the review after being assessed for methodological quality. All of the included studies had used a mathematical model to determine the effectiveness of an HPV vaccine, whilst 13 had also conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis. Although the studies used different model structures, baseline parameters and assumptions, all studies showed that vaccination would decrease rates of HPV infection, precancerous lesions and cervical cancer. Studies had a consistent message with respect to cost effectiveness: a female-only vaccination programme is cost effective compared with the current cytology-based Pap smear screening programme, while the cost effectiveness of a male and female vaccination programme is generally not cost effective compared with female-only vaccination.;Pharmacoeconomics. 2009.27(2):127-47. doi: 10.2165/00019053-200927020-00004.;Marra F1, Cloutier K, Oteng B, Marra C, Ogilvie G.;19254046;Review,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Early Detection of Cancer*,Female,Humans,Immunization Programs/economics*,Markov Chains,Models, Economic,Papillomavirus Infections/economics,Papillomavirus Infections/prevention & control*,Papillomavirus Vaccines/economics*,Papillomavirus Vaccines/therapeutic use,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/economics,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/virology,Women's Health,Papillomavirus Vaccines;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.472"one",Controlling cervical cancer.;;;;19254043;Comment,Editorial,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Early Detection of Cancer*,Female,Humans,Immunization Programs/economics*,Models, Economic,Papillomavirus Infections/economics,Papillomavirus Infections/prevention & control*,Papillomavirus Vaccines/economics*,Papillomavirus Vaccines/therapeutic use,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/economics,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/virology,Women's Health,Papillomavirus Vaccines;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.192"one",Health and economic impact associated with a quadrivalent HPV vaccine in Italy.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the health impact and cost-effectiveness of introducing a human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination programme with a quadrivalent vaccine alongside the existing cervical cancer screening programme in comparison to the current context in Italy. METHODS: A US Markov model was adapted to the Italian context, assuming under base case 80% vaccine coverage rate, lifetime duration of protection in a cohort of girls aged 12 years and discount rates of 1.5% and 3% for health benefits and costs, respectively, and estimating direct medical costs. RESULTS: The HPV vaccination in association with the current screening programme would allow to avoid 1432 cases of cervical cancer (-63.3%) and 513 deaths (-63.4%) compared to screening only, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 9569 euros per additional quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. The sensitivity analysis highlighted that this model was robust to all parameters presenting uncertainties as the ICERs ranged from 2,781 euros to 48,122 euros per QALY gained.

A Markov model was used across five geographic regions (Canada, The Netherlands, Taiwan, UK, US) to examine the clinical benefits and cost-effectiveness of: (1) vaccination combined with screening, considering changes to screening-related parameters and (2) vaccination combined with screening, considering changes to screening policy. Given the assumptions used in this analysis, adding vaccination to current screening is likely to be cost-effective in the regions studied. When considering vaccination with several plausible changes to screening programmes, locations with the most frequent Papanicolaou smear testing may achieve the most efficiency gains by adopting a less frequent screening interval or incorporating HPV testing into their screening practices. Although it may be beneficial to change screening to maximize efficiency, the most cost-effective strategies for vaccination and screening combinations may not lead to the greatest reductions in cervical cancer. therefore such policy decisions may vary depending on region-specific goals. Finally, new screening paradigms such as primary HPV testing should be considered in future analyses.;Vaccine. 2008 Sep 15.26 Suppl 5:F46-58. doi: 10.1016/j.vaccine.2008.02.039.;Rogoza RM1, Ferko N, Bentley J, Meijer CJ, Berkhof J, Wang KL, Downs L, Smith JS, Franco EL.;18992382;Female,Humans,Models, Econometric*,Papillomavirus Infections/economics*,Papillomavirus Infections/prevention & control*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/economics*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Vaccination/economics*;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.544"one",Mathematical models of cervical cancer prevention in Latin America and the Caribbean.;Abstract Using population and epidemiologic data for 33 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), a model-based approach estimated averted cervical cancer cases and deaths, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (I$/DALY averted) for human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination of young adolescent girls. Absolute reduction in lifetime cancer risk varied between countries, depending on incidence, proportion attributable to HPV-16 and 18, and population age-structure. for example, with 70% coverage, cancer reduction ranged from 40% in Mexico to more than 50% in Argentina. Screening of women over age 30 three times per lifetime, after vaccinating them as pre-adolescents, is expected to provide a relative increase of 25% to 30% in mortality reduction. Countries with the highest risk of cancer (age-standardized rate > 33.6) accounted for only 34% of deaths averted with vaccination, highlighting why a regional universal vaccination approach will be most effective in reducing the overall global burden. At I$25 per vaccinated girl ($5 per dose), for all 33 countries, the cost per DALY averted is less than I$400. at I$10 ($2 per dose) the vaccine is cost saving in 26 out of 33 countries. For all countries, ratios become less attractive (i.e., increase) as the cost of the vaccine increases. For example, at current vaccine prices ($120 per dose), the cost per DALY averted is I$7,300 in Mexico, I$3,700 in Nicaragua, and I$6,300 in Costa Rica. Vaccine price has an even greater effect on predicted affordability. For the 33 countries, vaccinating 5 consecutive birth cohorts at 70% coverage would cost $360 million at $5.00 per dose, $811 million at $12.25 per dose, and $1.26 billion at $19.50 per dose. In the LAC region, if effective delivery mechanisms can achieve high coverage rates in young adolescent girls, vaccination against HPV-16 and 18 will provide similar health value for resources invested as other new vaccines such as rotavirus. If the cost per vaccinated girl is less than I$25 HPV-16/18 vaccination would be very cost-effective in all 33 countries. for it to be affordable, costs may need to be lower.;Vaccine. 2008 Aug 19.26 Suppl 11:L59-72. doi: 10.1016/j.vaccine.2008.05.063.;Goldie SJ1, Diaz M, Constenla D, Alvis N, Andrus JK, Kim SY.;18945403;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adolescent,Adult,Calibration,Caribbean Region/epidemiology,Child,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Databases, Factual,Epidemiologic Methods,Epidemiologic Research Design*,Female,Humans,Latin America/epidemiology,Models, Statistical*,Software,Stochastic Processes,Treatment Outcome,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/economics,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.54"one",The cost-effectiveness of a quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine in Taiwan.;Abstract BACKGROUND: A quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV 6/11/16/18) vaccine has recently received regulatory approval in Taiwan for the prevention of cervical carcinoma, high-grade cervical dysplasia (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2/3 [CIN 2/3]), low-grade cervical dysplasia (CIN 1), high-grade vulvar and vaginal dysplasia, and external genital warts. OBJECTIVE: To examine the potential long-term epidemiologic and economic consequences of a quadrivalent HPV (6/11/16/18) vaccination program in Taiwan. METHODS: A transmission dynamic model was used to estimate the long-term epidemiologic and economic consequences of quadrivalent HPV vaccination. Two vaccination strategies were evaluated in conjunction with current cervical cancer screening: 1) vaccination of 12-year-old girls and 2) vaccination of 12-year-old girls with a temporary 5-year catch-up vaccination of females aged 12-24 years (catch-up). RESULTS: From an epidemiologic perspective, both vaccination strategies reduce the overall incidence of HPV 16/18-related cervical cancer relative to no vaccination by 91% during year 100 following vaccine introduction. Likewise, both vaccination strategies reduce the incidence of CIN 2/3, CIN 1, and genital warts by approximately 90%, 86%, and 94%, respectively, at this time point. However, the catch-up program consistently achieves greater benefit earlier than the 12-year-old program. The catch-up strategy is both more effective and efficient than the strategy that vaccinates 12-year-old girls only, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of New Taiwan dollars (NT$) 410,477 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. CONCLUSIONS: The results from this model suggest that in Taiwan, prophylactic HPV 6/11/16/18 vaccination of females can: 1) substantially reduce genital warts, CIN, and cervical cancer. 2) improve quality of life and survival. and 3) be cost-effective when implemented as a vaccination strategy that includes a temporary catch-up program.;Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2008 Jul-Sep.9(3):459-66.;Dasbach EJ1, Insinga RP, Yang YC, Pwu RF, Lac C, Elbasha EH.;18990021;Adolescent,Adult,Age Factors,Child,Cohort Studies,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Female,Humans,Mass Vaccination/economics*,Models, Economic,Papillomavirus Infections/economics,Papillomavirus Infections/epidemiology,Papillomavirus Infections/prevention & control*,Papillomavirus Vaccines/administration & dosage,Papillomavirus Vaccines/economics*,Reproducibility of Results,Risk Assessment,Taiwan,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/economics,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Vaccination/economics*,Young Adult,Papillomavirus Vaccines;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.588"not valid",A multi-type HPV transmission model.;Abstract A prophylactic quadrivalent (types 6/11/16/18) vaccine against oncogenic and warts-causing genital Human papillomavirus (HPV) types was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2006.

Because the risk of cervical cancer diminishes with effective routine screening, women may wish to consider additional attributes, such as the likelihood of false-positive results and diagnostic procedures for mild abnormalities likely to resolve without intervention in their screening choices. METHODS: We used an empirically calibrated simulation model of cervical cancer in the United States to assess the benefits and potential risks associated with prevention strategies differing by primary screening test, triage test for abnormal results (cytologic testing, human papillomavirus [HPV] DNA test), and screening frequency. Outcomes included colposcopy referrals, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) types 1 and 2 or 3, lifetime cancer risk, and quality-adjusted life expectancy. RESULTS: Across strategies, colposcopy referrals and diagnostic workups varied 3-fold, although diagnostic rates of CIN 2 or 3 were similar and 95% of positive screening test results were for mild abnormalities likely to resolve on their own. For a representative group of a thousand 20-year-old women undergoing triennial screening for 10 years, we expect 1038 colposcopy referrals (7 CIN 2 or 3 diagnoses) from combined cytologic and HPV DNA testing and fewer than 200 referrals (6-7 CIN 2 or 3 diagnoses) for strategies that use triage testing. Similarly, for a thousand 40-year-old women, combined cytologic and HPV DNA testing led to 489 referrals (9 CIN 2 or 3), whereas alternative strategies resulted in fewer than 150 referrals (7-8 CIN 2 or 3). Using cytologic testing followed by triage testing in younger women minimizes both diagnostic workups and positive HPV test results, whereas in older women diagnostic workups are minimized with HPV DNA testing followed by cytologic triage testing. CONCLUSIONS: Clinically relevant information highlighting trade-offs among cervical cancer prevention strategies allows for inclusion of personal preferences into women's decision making about screening and provides additional dimensions to the construction of clinical guidelines.;Arch Intern Med. 2008 Sep 22.168(17):1881-9. doi: 10.1001/archinte.168.17.1881.;Stout NK1, Goldhaber-Fiebert JD, Ortendahl JD, Goldie SJ.;18809815;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/diagnosis*,Colposcopy,DNA Probes, HPV,Decision Making,False Positive Reactions,Female,Humans,Life Expectancy,Models, Theoretical,Quality of Life,Referral and Consultation,Sensitivity and Specificity,Triage,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*,DNA Probes, HPV,R01 CA093435/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,R01 CA093435-04A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.288"one",Exploring the cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination in Vietnam: insights for evidence-based cervical cancer prevention policy.;Abstract Using mathematical models of cervical cancer for the northern and southern regions of Vietnam, we assessed the cost-effectiveness of cervical cancer prevention strategies and the tradeoffs between a national and region-based policy in Vietnam. With 70% vaccination and screening coverage, lifetime risk of cancer was reduced by 20.4-76.1% with vaccination of pre-adolescent girls and/or screening of older women. Only when the cost per vaccinated girl was low (i.e., <I$25) was vaccination combined with screening (three times per lifetime or every 5 years) favored in both regions. at high costs per vaccinated girl (i.e., >I$100), screening alone was most cost-effective. When optimal policies differed between regions, implementing a national strategy resulted in health and economic inefficiencies. HPV vaccination appears to be an attractive cervical cancer prevention strategy for Vietnam, provided high coverage can be achieved in young pre-adolescent girls, cost per vaccinated girl is <I$25 (i.e., <$5 per dose), and screening is offered at older ages.;Vaccine. 2008 Jul 29.26(32):4015-24. doi: 10.1016/j.vaccine.2008.05.038.

METHODS: A graphical technique has been developed using data on referral to colposcopy and histological outcomes called a referral outcome (ROUT) diagram. The average grade of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) detected (the mean CIN score, MCS) is plotted against the odds of a false-positive referral. Further analysis has been conducted to examine the relationship between the MCS and screen-detected invasive cancer rate. RESULTS: There are large variations in ROUT diagram positions of individual laboratories and the diagram can be used to identify laboratories for further investigation. These variations are strongly influenced by substantial differences in the rate of low-grade referrals and the MCS (and positive predictive value) are inversely related to the referral rate for low-grade cytology (P < 0.001). There is a strong association between high MCS values and increased screen-detected cancer rates (P < 0.001) particularly above an MCS of 2.2. The data can be re-formulated in terms of CIN 2 and CIN 3 only where it can be shown that the invasive cancer rate rapidly increases if the numbers of CIN 2 lesions detected drops below 50% of the number of CIN 3 lesions. Given the complexity of cervical screening this may best be viewed as a hypothesis generating observation, best tested by interventional studies. CONCLUSIONS: The ROUT diagram represents a new and potentially interesting way of presenting annual return data. The national programme in England needs to balance the prevention of cancer against too many unnecessary referrals to colposcopy and the ROUT diagram, and associated data given in this paper may help toward this. Further research is required including examining the role of referral policy and threshold criteria in influencing low-grade referrals and the relationship between MCS and cancer detection rate.;Cytopathology. 2008 Aug.19(4):244-53. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2303.2008.00558.x.

Under base-case parameter values, the estimated cost per quality-adjusted life year gained by vaccination in the context of current cervical cancer screening practices in the United States ranged from $3,906 to $14,723 (2005 US dollars), depending on factors such as whether herd immunity effects were assumed. the types of HPV targeted by the vaccine. and whether the benefits of preventing anal, vaginal, vulvar, and oropharyngeal cancers were included. The results of our simplified model were consistent with published studies based on more complex models when key assumptions were similar. This consistency is reassuring because models of varying complexity will be essential tools for policy makers in the development of optimal HPV vaccination strategies.;Emerg Infect Dis. 2008 Feb.14(2):244-51. doi: 10.3201/eid1402.070499.;Chesson HW1, Ekwueme DU, Saraiya M, Markowitz LE.;18258117;Adolescent,Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/diagnosis,Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/prevention & control,Child,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Disease Progression,Female,Health Policy,Humans,Immunization Programs,Models, Econometric*,Papillomaviridae/immunology*,Papillomavirus Infections/economics*,Papillomavirus Infections/epidemiology,Papillomavirus Infections/prevention & control*,Papillomavirus Vaccines*/administration & dosage,Papillomavirus Vaccines*/economics,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,United States,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control,Vaccination/economics*,Papillomavirus Vaccines;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.5"one",Cost-effectiveness analysis of the introduction of a quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine in France.;Abstract OBJECTIVES: A vaccine to prevent diseases due to human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16, and 18 is now available in France. The objective of this study was to assess the health and economic impact in France of implementing a quadrivalent HPV vaccine alongside existing screening practices versus screening alone. METHODS: A Markov model of the natural history of HPV infection incorporating screening and vaccination, was adapted to the French context. A vaccine that would prevent 100 percent of HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18-associated diseases, with lifetime duration and 80 percent coverage, given to girls at age 14 in conjunction with current screening was compared with screening alone. Results were analyzed from both a direct healthcare cost perspective (DCP) and a third-party payer perspective (TPP). Indirect costs such as productivity loss were not taken into account in this analysis. RESULTS: The incremental cost per life-year gained from vaccination was euro12,429 (TPP) and euro20,455 (DCP). The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) for the introduction of HPV vaccination alongside the French cervical cancer screening program was euro8,408 (TPP) and euro13,809 (DCP). Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that cost-effectiveness was stable, but was most sensitive to the discount rate used for costs and benefits. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the commonly accepted threshold of euro50,000 per QALY, these analyses support the fact that adding a quadrivalent HPV vaccine to the current screening program in France is a cost-effective strategy for reducing the burden of cervical cancer, precancerous lesions, and genital warts caused by HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18.;Int J Technol Assess Health Care. 2008 Winter.24(1):10-9. doi: 10.1017/S0266462307080026.;Bergeron C1, Largeron N, McAllister R, Mathevet P, Remy V.;18218164;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adolescent,Adult,Aged,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Female,France,Health Care Costs,Humans,Markov Chains,Mass Screening/economics*,Middle Aged,Papillomavirus Infections/prevention & control*,Papillomavirus Vaccines/classification,Papillomavirus Vaccines/economics*,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control,Papillomavirus Vaccines;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.692"valid",A cost-effectiveness analysis of adding a human papillomavirus vaccine to the Australian National Cervical Cancer Screening Program.;Abstract BACKGROUND: The cost-effectiveness of adding a human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine to the Australian National Cervical Screening Program compared to screening alone was examined. METHODS: A Markov model of the natural history of HPV infection that incorporates screening and vaccination was developed. A vaccine that prevents 100% of HPV 16/18-associated disease, with a lifetime duration of efficacy and 80% coverage offered through a school program to girls aged 12 years, in conjunction with current screening was compared with screening alone using cost (in Australian dollars) per life-year (LY) saved and quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) saved. Sensitivity analyses included determining the cost-effectiveness of offering a catch-up vaccination program to 14-26-year-olds and accounting for the benefits of herd immunity. RESULTS: Vaccination with screening compared with screening alone was associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $51 103 per LY and $18 735 per QALY, assuming a cost per vaccine dose of $115. Results were sensitive to assumptions about the duration of vaccine efficacy, including the need for a booster ($68 158 per LY and $24 988 per QALY) to produce lifetime immunity. Accounting for herd immunity resulted in a more attractive ICER ($36 343 per LY and $13 316 per QALY) for girls only. The cost per LY of vaccinating boys and girls was $92 052 and the cost per QALY was $33 644. The cost per LY of implementing a catch-up vaccination program ranged from $45 652 ($16 727 per QALY) for extending vaccination to 14-year-olds to $78 702 ($34 536 per QALY) for 26-year-olds. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that adding an HPV vaccine to Australia's current screening regimen is a potentially cost-effective way to reduce cervical cancer and the clinical interventions that are currently associated with its prevention via screening alone.;Sex Health. 2007 Sep.4(3):165-75.;Kulasingam S1, Connelly L, Conway E, Hocking JS, Myers E, Regan DG, Roder D, Ross J, Wain G.;17931529;Adolescent,Australia/epidemiology,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Decision Support Techniques*,Female,Human papillomavirus 16*,Humans,Markov Chains,Mass Vaccination/economics*,Mass Vaccination/statistics & numerical data,National Health Programs/economics,Papillomavirus Infections/economics*,Papillomavirus Infections/epidemiology,Papillomavirus Infections/prevention & control,Papillomavirus Vaccines/economics*,Papillomavirus Vaccines/therapeutic use,Quality of Life,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/economics*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control,Papillomavirus Vaccines;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.72"one",Risk assessment to guide the prevention of cervical cancer.;Abstract Advances in screening and diagnosis make it increasingly possible to prevent cervical cancer. However, if misused or poorly understood, these new tools will only increase costs and potentially harm patients without benefit. As a framework for standardized care that maximizes patient safety and well-being, we propose that a risk model be adopted to guide clinical management now and in the future. The model would use thresholds of increasing risk for cervical precancer and treatable cancer to guide clinical decision making for screening intensity, diagnostic evaluation, or treatment. Experts would decide on these risk thresholds and stratum based on the patient risk to benefit, independent of current (eg, cytology, carcinogenic HPV testing, and colposcopy) and future methods of measuring risk. A risk management model for cervical cancer prevention, based on appropriate clinical actions that correspond to risk stratum, can result in better allocation of resources to and increased safety for women at the greatest risk and increased well-being for women at the lowest risk.;Am J Obstet Gynecol. 2007 Oct.197(4):356.e1-6.;Castle PE1, Sideri M, Jeronimo J, Solomon D, Schiffman M.;17904958;Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural,Review,Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/pathology,Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/prevention & control*,Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/virology,Female,Humans,Models, Statistical,Papillomaviridae/growth & development,Papillomavirus Infections/pathology*,Papillomavirus Infections/virology,Precancerous Conditions/pathology,Precancerous Conditions/prevention & control*,Precancerous Conditions/virology,Risk Assessment,Risk Management,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/pathology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/virology,Z99 CA999999/NULL/Intramural NIH HHS/United States;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.224"one",[Impact of vaccination against oncogenic human papillomavirus on the incidence and mortality of cervical cancer in Germany].;Abstract BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a necessary cause for cervical cancer. HPV vaccines covering genotypes 16 and 18 for the prevention of cervical cancer are or will be available soon (status: May 2007). Vaccination against HPV in order to reduce the burden of cervical cancer is recommended by the Standing Committee on Vaccination (STIKO) for female adolescents aged 12-17 years in Germany. The study aims to evaluate the achievable long-term impact of HPV vaccination on invasive cervical cancer (ICC) incidence and mortality in Germany, a country with an opportunistic Pap screening program and suboptimal participation. METHODS: The authors developed a decision-analytic discrete-event model and used Monte Carlo simulation to assess the impact of vaccination on ICC incidence and life expectancy of a cohort of 399,400 10-year-old girls. HPV-16 and HPV-18 account for 73.5% of cancers. In the model, a 100% vaccination rate between 10 and 25 years, and a vaccine efficacy of 95.1% were assumed. RESULTS: Without vaccination, 4,563 ICC cases occur in the cohort (cumulative lifetime incidence: 1.14%), 1,376 women will die from ICC (fatality: 30.2%). Vaccination at age 10 can reduce incidence and mortality by 70% resulting in a gain of 17,819 life-years. 416 girls have to be vaccinated to prevent one death from ICC. Delaying vaccination to women aged 25 years still leads to a 50% reduction of deaths. CONCLUSION: Despite cytological screening, a high disease burden of cervical cancer remains in Germany. Vaccination in early adolescence can drastically reduce the disease burden. Vaccination of adult women still offers significant benefits. Therefore, HPV vaccination should be added to existing cancer prevention strategies.;Med Klin (Munich). 2007 Jul 15.102(7):515-23.;Schneider A1, Schwarz TF, Hammerschmidt T, Siebert U.;17634869;English Abstract,Adult,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Cohort Studies,Female,Germany,Human papillomavirus 16/immunology*,Human papillomavirus 18/immunology*,Humans,Immunization Programs*/statistics & numerical data,Middle Aged,Monte Carlo Method,Papillomavirus Infections/mortality,Papillomavirus Infections/prevention & control*,Papillomavirus Vaccines/administration & dosage*,Survival Analysis,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/immunology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/mortality,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Papillomavirus Vaccines;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.272"one",Efficacy and cost-effectiveness of nationwide cervical cancer screening in Taiwan.;Abstract The annual cervical screening programme using the Papanicolaou (Pap) smear test was launched for women aged 30 years and over from 1995 in Taiwan. This study aimed to evaluate the Taiwanese cervical screening policy and to make recommendations based on the empirical findings from cervical screening data between 1995 and 1998. We used a stochastic process to model the natural history of precancerous lesions and cervical cancer. Based on the estimated results, Monte-Carlo computer simulation was used to evaluate the effectiveness in terms of the reduction in incidence of and mortality from cervical cancer for screening regimes with different screening intervals. Annual Pap smear screening with 100% compliance was estimated to lead to an approximate 80% reduction in deaths from cervical cancer. With 50% compliance, around a 40% reduction was expected. Triennial screening with high compliance was as effective as annual screening with low compliance, and more cost-effective. Based on the observed Taiwan Pap smear-screening programme between 1995 and 1998, with 44.5% women attending at least once, there was an estimated reduction of 16% in deaths from cervical carcinoma. The estimated effectiveness was greater when the period was extended to 2001, in which period 61% of women attended at least once. The screening programme by 2001 was estimated to reduce cervical cancer mortality by 50% (95% confidence interval: 29-65%). The incremental cost-effectiveness was estimated as 8174 dollars per additional life-year gained. In conclusion, triennial screening targeting women aged 30-69 is recommended, along with efforts to enhance the compliance rate.;J Med Screen. 2006.13 Suppl 1:S44-7.;Koong SL1, Yen AM, Chen TH.;17227642;Adult,Aged,Computer Simulation,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Female,Humans,Mass Screening/economics,Mass Screening/methods*,Mass Screening/statistics & numerical data,Middle Aged,Monte Carlo Method,Papanicolaou Test,Taiwan,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control,Vaginal Smears/methods,Vaginal Smears/statistics & numerical data;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.64"one",Estimating the long-term impact of a prophylactic human papillomavirus 16/18 vaccine on the burden of cervical cancer in the UK.;Abstract To predict the public health impact on cervical disease by introducing human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination in the United Kingdom, we developed a mathematical model that can be used to reflect the impact of vaccination in different countries with existing screening programmes. Its use is discussed in the context of the United Kingdom. The model was calibrated with published data. The impact of vaccination on cervical cancer and deaths, precancerous lesions and screening outcomes were estimated for a vaccinated cohort of 12-year-old girls, among which it is estimated that there would be a reduction of 66% in the prevalence of high-grade precancerous lesions and a 76% reduction in cervical cancer deaths. Estimates for various other measures of the population effects of vaccination are also presented. We concluded that it is feasible to forecast the potential effects of HPV vaccination in the context of an existing national screening programme. Results suggest a sizable reduction in the incidence of cervical cancer and related deaths.

Theoretically, education can enhance the demand for preventative health services by raising awareness of the importance of undertaking regular health check-ups and may also improve the ways in which individuals understand information regarding periodical tests, communicate with the health practitioner, and interpret results. Furthermore, education enhances the inclusion of individuals in society, improving self-efficacy and confidence. All these factors may increase service uptake. The empirical analysis uses data from the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) and applies techniques for discrete panel data to estimate the parameters of the model. Results show that adult learning leading to qualifications is statistically associated with an increase in the uptake of screening. The marginal effect indicates that participation in courses leading to qualifications increases the probability of having a smear test between 4.3 and 4.4 percentage points. This estimate is strongly robust to time-invariant selectivity bias in education and the inclusion of income, class, occupation, and parental socio-economic status. These findings enrich existing evidence on the socio-economic determinants of screening for cervical cancer and enable policy makers to better understand barriers to service uptake.;Soc Sci Med. 2006 Jun.62(12):2998-3010.

We explored the clinical benefits and cost-effectiveness of introducing an HPV16/18 vaccine in a population with an organized cervical cancer screening program. METHODS: A computer-based model of the natural history of HPV and cervical cancer was used to project cancer incidence and mortality, life expectancy (adjusted and unadjusted for quality of life), lifetime costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (i.e., the additional cost of a strategy divided by its additional clinical benefit compared with the next most expensive strategy) associated with different cancer prevention policies, including vaccination (initiated at age 12 years), cytologic screening (initiated at 18, 21, 25, 30, or 35 years), and combined vaccination and screening strategies. We assumed that vaccination was 90% effective in reducing the risk of persistent HPV16/18 infections and evaluated alternative assumptions about vaccine efficacy, waning immunity, and risk of replacement with non-16/18 HPV types. RESULTS: Our model showed that the most effective strategy with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of less than 60 dollars-000 per quality-adjusted life year is one combining vaccination at age 12 years with triennial conventional cytologic screening beginning at age 25 years, compared with the next best strategy of vaccination and cytologic screening every 5 years beginning at age 21 years. This triennial strategy would reduce the absolute lifetime risk of cervical cancer by 94% compared with no intervention. These results were sensitive to alternative assumptions about the underlying patterns of cervical cancer screening, duration of vaccine efficacy, and natural history of HPV infection in older women. CONCLUSIONS: Our model predicts that a vaccine that prevents persistent HPV16/18 infection will reduce the incidence of HPV16/18-associated cervical cancer, even in a setting of cytologic screening. A program of vaccination that permits a later age of screening initiation and a less frequent screening interval is likely to be a cost-effective use of health care resources.;J Natl Cancer Inst. 2004 Apr 21.96(8):604-15.;Goldie SJ1, Kohli M, Grima D, Weinstein MC, Wright TC, Bosch FX, Franco E.;15100338;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.,Adult,Aged,Computer Simulation,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Decision Support Techniques,Female,Humans,Incidence,Markov Chains,Mass Screening/standards,Middle Aged,Papillomaviridae*,Papillomavirus Infections/complications,Papillomavirus Infections/economics,Papillomavirus Infections/prevention & control*,Papillomavirus Vaccines*,Tumor Virus Infections/complications,Tumor Virus Infections/economics,Tumor Virus Infections/prevention & control*,United States/epidemiology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/economics,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/mortality,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/virology,Viral Vaccines/economics*,Viral Vaccines/therapeutic use*,Papillomavirus Vaccines,Viral Vaccines,R01-CA93435/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.676"one",Monitoring and evaluating the performance of the UK NHS Cervical Screening Programme: monitoring performance by using cytology outcomes adjusted for population characteristics.;Abstract Current quality assurance measures used in the NHS cervical screening programme (NHSCSP) include a review of laboratories with percentages of moderate/severe and borderline/mild smear results outside the 10th-90th percentiles. The method is limited by the fact that many of these outlier smear percentages may reflect laboratories covering populations with low or high risk and/or short or long average screening intervals. This paper outlines a new approach to aid the detection of outlier laboratories, by using data collected at the primary care trust (PCT) or health authority (HA) level and making allowances for population characteristics and screening interval. The setting is the NHSCSP in England using annual data provided by HAs. Data from the screening year 2000-01 is used to illustrate the methodology, although the methods can also be applied to data at the PCT level (now being collected for 2002-03 onwards). Percentages of smear results have been analysed against a series of explanatory variables using logistic regression models. These explanatory variables include Townsend deprivation index, uptake-corrected ethnic minority composition, a measure of screening interval, area type and region. An expected percentage of borderline/mild and moderate/severe smears is estimated from the models and an observed : predicted ratio (OPRmod/sev and OPRbord/mild) calculated. Low values are suggestive of relative undercalling and high values overcalling, after allowance for population characteristics. Analysis of data for 2000-01 showed that the OPRmod/sev for the 99 HAs varied from 0.68 to 1.44. Laboratories with low percentages of moderate/severe smears, but associated with PCTs or HAs with OPRmod/sev values closer to unity may not need to be investigated as their observed rates are consistent with predicted rates based on population characteristics. The method could also be directly applied to laboratories if further information on the population covered by each laboratory were routinely collected.;Cytopathology. 2004 Feb.15(1):5-11.;Blanks RG1, Waller M, Sanchez-Galvez A, Moss SM.;14748785;Evaluation Studies,Female,Humans,Mass Screening,Models, Statistical,Quality Assurance, Health Care*,Regression Analysis,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Vaginal Smears/standards*;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.3"valid",Potential health and economic impact of adding a human papillomavirus vaccine to screening programs.;Abstract CONTEXT: Recently published results suggest that effective vaccines against cervical cancer-associated human papillomavirus (HPV) may become available within the next decade. OBJECTIVE: To examine the potential health and economic effects of an HPV vaccine in a setting of existing screening. DESIGN, SETTING, AND POPULATION: A Markov model was used to estimate the lifetime (age 12-85 years) costs and life expectancy of a hypothetical cohort of women screened for cervical cancer in the United States. Three strategies were compared: (1) vaccination only. (2) conventional cytological screening only. and (3) vaccination followed by screening. Two of the strategies incorporated a vaccine targeted against a defined proportion of high-risk (oncogenic) HPV types. Screening intervals of 1, 2, 3, and 5 years and starting ages for screening of 18, 22, 24, 26, and 30 years were chosen for 2 of the strategies (conventional cytological screening only and vaccination followed by screening). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental cost per life-year gained. RESULTS: Vaccination only or adding vaccination to screening conducted every 3 and 5 years was not cost-effective. However, at more frequent screening intervals, strategies combining vaccination and screening were preferred. Vaccination plus biennial screening delayed until age 24 years had the most attractive cost-effectiveness ratio (44 889 dollars) compared with screening only beginning at age 18 years and conducted every 3 years. However, the strategy of vaccination with annual screening beginning at age 18 years had the largest overall reduction in cancer incidence and mortality at a cost of 236 250 dollars per life-year gained compared with vaccination and annual screening beginning at age 22 years. The cost-effectiveness of vaccination plus delayed screening was highly sensitive to age of vaccination, duration of vaccine efficacy, and cost of vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination for HPV in combination with screening can be a cost-effective health intervention, but it depends on maintaining effectiveness during the ages of peak oncogenic HPV incidence. Identifying the optimal age for vaccination should be a top research priority.;JAMA. 2003 Aug 13.290(6):781-9.;Kulasingam SL1, Myers ER.;12915431;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adolescent,Adult,Age Factors,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/pathology,Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/prevention & control*,Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/virology,Colposcopy/economics,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Disease Progression,Female,Humans,Life Expectancy,Markov Chains,Mass Screening/economics,Middle Aged,Models, Theoretical,Papillomaviridae*/immunology,Papillomaviridae*/isolation & purification,Papillomavirus Infections/pathology,Papillomavirus Infections/prevention & control*,Papillomavirus Vaccines*,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,Tumor Virus Infections/pathology,Tumor Virus Infections/prevention & control*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/pathology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/virology,Vaccination/economics*,Vaginal Smears/economics,Viral Vaccines/administration & dosage,Viral Vaccines/economics*,Papillomavirus Vaccines,Viral Vaccines;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.744"valid",Benefits and costs of using HPV testing to screen for cervical cancer.;Abstract CONTEXT: Despite quality assurance standards, Papanicolaou (Pap) test characteristics remain less than optimal. OBJECTIVE: To compare the societal costs and benefits of human papillomavirus (HPV) testing, Pap testing, and their combination to screen for cervical cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND POPULATION: A simulation model of neoplasia natural history was used to estimate the societal costs and quality-adjusted life expectancy associated with 18 different general population screening strategies: Pap plus HPV testing, Pap testing alone, and HPV testing alone every 2 or 3 years among hypothetical longitudinal cohorts of US women beginning at age 20 years and continuing to 65 years, 75 years, or death. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Discounted costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) saved of each screening strategy. RESULTS: Maximal savings in lives were achieved by screening every 2 years until death with combined HPV and Pap testing at an incremental cost of $76 183 per QALY compared with Pap testing alone every 2 years. Stopping biennial screening with HPV and Pap testing at age 75 years captures 97.8% of the benefits of lifetime screening at a cost of $70 347 per QALY. Combined biennial HPV and Pap testing to age 65 years captures 86.6% of the benefits achievable by continuing to screen until age 75 years. Human papillomavirus screening alone was equally effective as Pap testing alone at any given screening interval or age of screening cessation but was more costly and therefore was dominated. In sensitivity analyses, HPV testing would be more effective and less costly than Pap testing at a cost threshold of $5 for an HPV test. CONCLUSIONS: Screening with HPV plus Pap tests every 2 years appears to save additional years of life at reasonable costs compared with Pap testing alone. Applying age limits to screening is a viable option to maintain benefits while reducing costs.;JAMA. 2002 May 8.287(18):2372-81.;Mandelblatt JS1, Lawrence WF, Womack SM, Jacobson D, Yi B, Hwang YT, Gold K, Barter J, Shah K.;11988058;Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.,Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.,Adult,Aged,Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/diagnosis,Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/economics,Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/prevention & control,Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/virology,Cost-Benefit Analysis,DNA, Viral/analysis,Female,Humans,Mass Screening/economics*,Mass Screening/methods,Middle Aged,Models, Theoretical,Papanicolaou Test*,Papillomaviridae/isolation & purification*,Papillomavirus Infections/diagnosis*,Polymerase Chain Reaction/economics,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,Tumor Virus Infections/diagnosis*,United States,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/economics,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/virology*,Vaginal Smears/economics*,DNA, Viral,R01-AG15340/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.736"not valid",Impact of increasing Papanicolaou test sensitivity and compliance: a modeled cost and outcomes analysis.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: To model the impact of increasing screening compliance or implementing liquid-based cytology in populations with known compliance patterns and risk profiles on rates of detection of cervical precancers. METHODS: An adaptation of a time-varying Markov model was used to follow a theoretic cohort of 100,000 women from age 20 through age 80. Separate analyses of all women, white, and black women were completed using three compliance rates (self-reported, Healthy People 2000, and Healthy People 2010 compliance) and two Papanicolaou test sensitivities (conventional Papanicolaou smear and liquid-based cytology). RESULTS: All populations benefited from both increased compliance and liquid-based cytology use. Increasing compliance to Healthy People 2010 goals resulted in 23%, 21.7%, and 17% reductions in cervical cancer incidence for all women, white, and black women, respectively. Substituting liquid-based cytology for traditional Papanicolaou smear collection and processing with no change in compliance resulted in 32%, 32%, and 33% reductions in cervical cancer incidence for the same three subpopulations. In addition, cost-effectiveness of the liquid-based technology indirectly related to the risk profile of the population: for black women, the cost-effectiveness ratio was $10,335 per life year saved, whereas for white women, the ratio was $17,967 per life year saved. CONCLUSION: Using liquid-based cytology in all populations would be cost-effective in improving outcomes from cervical cancer. In high-risk populations, this new technology may represent the most cost-effective approach to improve cervical cancer outcomes.;Obstet Gynecol. 2001 May.97(5 Pt 1):781-8.;Montz FJ1, Farber FL, Bristow RE, Cornelison T.;11339934;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Age Distribution,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Cohort Studies,Computer Simulation,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Female,Humans,Linear Models,Middle Aged,Models, Economic*,Outcome and Process Assessment (Health Care)/statistics & numerical data*,Papanicolaou Test*,Patient Compliance,Population Surveillance,Risk Assessment,Sensitivity and Specificity,United States,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Vaginal Smears/economics*,Vaginal Smears/statistics & numerical data*;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.484"not valid",Overview of important cervical cancer screening process values in European Union (EU) countries, and tentative predictions of the corresponding effectiveness and cost-effectiveness.;Abstract The objective was the evaluation of the (cost-)effectiveness of cervical cancer screening in the European Union (EU) countries. Data were collected on recommended screening age ranges and intervals, coverage, proportion of non-negative smears and smear use. Estimates reported by representatives of each participating Member State were compared, and used as input for model based on (using the MISCAN simulation model for cancer screening) effectiveness and cost-effectiveness calculations. Differences in coverage from below 50 to 82% resulted in more or less proportional differences in expected percentage life-years lost reduction, almost regardless of differences in 7-50+ smears recommended in a lifetime. Differences in screening intensity (resulting from the recommended number of smears per lifetime and the number of excess smears on top of these recommendations) resulted in more than 2-fold difference in the expected number of smears per percentage life-years lost reduction. (Cost-)effectiveness predictions would have greatly improved if estimates of long-term coverage had also been available. To conclude, estimates for a restricted set of well defined parameters - a few for short and long-term coverage and one for the total number of smears - are quite useful for country-specific (cost-)effectiveness evaluations. The main, and to some extent, unsolvable problem for further improvement of the analysis is the lack of reliable country-specific estimates for the background risk of cervical cancer in women eligible for screening in the near future.;Eur J Cancer. 2000 Nov.36(17):2177-88.;van Ballegooijen M1, van den Akker-van Marle E, Patnick J, Lynge E, Arbyn M, Anttila A, Ronco G, Dik J, Habbema F.;11072201;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Age Distribution,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Europe/epidemiology,European Union,Female,Humans,Mass Screening/economics,Mass Screening/mortality,Mass Screening/organization & administration*,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,Sensitivity and Specificity,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/mortality,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Vaginal Smears/utilization;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.512"not valid",Clinical and cost implications of new technologies for cervical cancer screening: the impact of test sensitivity.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: To compare the available techniques for cervical cancer screening, including several new technologies, using actual program utilization patterns. STUDY DESIGN: Longitudinal cohort model. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The model followed a cohort of 100,000 women who underwent screening from age 20 through 65 years. The model was run with a weighted average of screening intervals to model the actual utilization of the cervical cancer screening program in the United States. RESULTS: The model demonstrated that new technologies with significantly increased test sensitivity have the potential to reduce the number of cancers by 45% to 60% depending on the screening frequency in fully compliant populations. At screening intervals of 2 years or more, these new technologies had cost-effectiveness ratios below $50,000 per life-year saved. Assuming existing utilization patterns, the model predicted there would be 13.2 cancers per year in the 100,000 women screened with the conventional Pap smear, and new technologies with increased test sensitivity could reduce the annual incidence to 9.5 cancers per 100,000 women screened. CONCLUSIONS: The model suggests that to achieve further dramatic reduction in cervical cancer mortality, significant improvements in test sensitivity, as reflected in the new screening technologies, may be the most realistic and cost-effective approach.;Am J Manag Care. 2000 Jul.6(7):766-80.;Hutchinson ML1, Berger BM, Farber FL.;11067374;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adolescent,Adult,Cohort Studies,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Female,Humans,Incidence,Longitudinal Studies,Markov Chains,Mass Screening/economics,Mass Screening/methods*,Mass Screening/utilization,Microbiological Techniques,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical,Papanicolaou Test*,Patient Compliance,Sensitivity and Specificity,United States/epidemiology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/microbiology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Utilization Review/economics*,Utilization Review/statistics & numerical data,Vaginal Smears/economics*,Vaginal Smears/trends,Vaginal Smears/utilization,Value of Life;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.548"valid",Cost-effectiveness of the conventional papanicolaou test with a new adjunct to cytological screening for squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix and its precursors.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: To estimate costs and outcomes of conventional annual Papanicolaou (Pap) test screening compared with biennial Pap test plus speculoscopy (PPS) screening for cervical neoplasms. DESIGN: A Markov model compared cost-effectiveness and outcomes of annual Pap tests with biennial PPS. The model includes direct costs of screening, diagnostic testing, and treatment for squamous intraepitheial lesions and invasive cancers. indirect costs (eg, lost productivity because of cervical cancer). and newer management practices, including human papillomavirus DNA testing. PATIENTS: Women aged 18 to 64 years. INTERVENTION: Screening for cervical neoplasms with either annual Pap smear test or biennial PPS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Marginal cost per life-year gained. RESULTS: The probability of women having squamous intraepithelial lesions, cervical cancer, or death from cervical cancer was lower among women undergoing PPS biennially. A total of 12 additional days of life per woman was gained with biennial PPS during the 47-year model period. Total average cumulative direct medical costs per patient were $1419 for biennial PPS compared with $1489 for annual Pap tests. Total costs, including direct medical costs and indirect costs, were $2185 for PPS compared with $3179 for Pap tests alone. Increased savings and patient outcomes were observed in high-risk populations. CONCLUSION: Our simulations indicate that biennial screening with PPS is expected to provide cost savings for women older than 18 years compared with annual Pap test screening, especially for those in high-risk populations.;Arch Fam Med. 2000 Aug.9(8):713-21.;Taylor LA1, Sorensen SV, Ray NF, Halpern MT, Harper DM.;10927709;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/economics*,Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/prevention & control*,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Female,Humans,Markov Chains,Mass Screening/economics*,Mass Screening/methods*,Middle Aged,Papanicolaou Test*,Risk,Time Factors,United States,Uterine Cervical Dysplasia/diagnosis*,Uterine Cervical Dysplasia/economics*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/economics*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Vaginal Smears/economics*;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.64"not valid",Cost-effectiveness of screening for anal squamous intraepithelial lesions and anal cancer in human immunodeficiency virus-negative homosexual and bisexual men.;Abstract PURPOSE: Homosexual and bisexual men are at an increased risk for human papillomavirus-induced squamous intraepithelial lesions and cancer of the anus. Our objective was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of screening for anal squamous intraepithelial lesions in these high-risk patients. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A Markov model was developed to evaluate alternative screening strategies using anal cytology in a hypothetical cohort of homosexual and bisexual men. Data were obtained from prospective cohort studies, national databases, Medicare reimbursement rates, and the published literature. Model outcomes included life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, total lifetime costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: The undiscounted life expectancy gain associated with anal cytology screening every 3 years was 5.5 months. Compared with no screening, screening every 3 years increased the discounted quality-adjusted life expectancy by 1.8 months and cost $7,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Screening every 2 years cost $15,100 per QALY gained compared with screening every 3 years. Annual screening provided incremental benefits of less than 0.5 quality-adjusted months and had an incremental cost of $34,800 per QALY gained. Screening every 6 months provided little additional benefit (i.e, 5 days) over that of annual screening and had an incremental cost of $143,500 per QALY gained. CONCLUSION: In homosexual and bisexual men, screening every 2 or 3 years for anal squamous intraepithelial lesions with anal cytology would provide life-expectancy benefits comparable with other accepted preventive health measures, and would be cost-effective.;Am J Med. 2000 Jun 1.108(8):634-41.;Goldie SJ1, Kuntz KM, Weinstein MC, Freedberg KA, Palefsky JM.;10856411;Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.,Adult,Anus Neoplasms/diagnosis,Anus Neoplasms/economics*,Anus Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Bisexuality*,Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/diagnosis,Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/economics*,Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/prevention & control*,Cost-Benefit Analysis,HIV Seronegativity*,Health Care Costs*,Homosexuality, Male*,Humans,Life Expectancy,Male,Markov Chains,Mass Screening/economics*,Middle Aged,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,United States,R01 CA054053/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,CA 54053/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,RR-00079/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.692"not valid",The costs, clinical benefits, and cost-effectiveness of screening for cervical cancer in HIV-infected women.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Women with HIV infection have a higher risk for cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions than do women without HIV infection, and the optimal regimen for cervical cancer screening in these women is uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To assess the net health consequences, costs, and cost-effectiveness of various screening strategies for cervical neoplasia and cancer in HIV-infected women. DESIGN: A cost-effectiveness analysis from a societal perspective done by using a state-transition Markov model. Values for incidence, progression, and regression of cervical neoplasia. efficacy of screening and treatment. progression of HIV disease. mortality from HIV infection and cancer. quality of life. and costs were obtained from the literature. SETTING: Simulated clinical practice in the United States. PATIENTS: HIV-infected women representative of the U.S. population. INTERVENTION: Six main screening strategies--no screening, annual Papanicolaou smears, annual Papanicolaou smears after two negative smears obtained 6 months apart (recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), semiannual Papanicolaou smears, annual colposcopy, and semiannual colposcopy--were considered. MEASUREMENTS: Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), lifetime costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: Annual Papanicolaou smear screening resulted in a 2.1-month gain in quality-adjusted life expectancy for an incremental cost of $12,800 per QALY saved. Annual Papanicolaou smear screening after two negative smears obtained 6 months apart provided an additional 0.04 QALYs at a cost of $14,800 per QALY saved. Semiannual Papanicolaou smear screening provided a further 0.17 QALYs at a cost of $27,600 per QALY saved. Annual colposcopy cost more but provided no additional benefit compared with that given by semiannual Papanicolaou smear screening, and semiannual colposcopy exceeded $375,000 per QALY saved. Results were most sensitive to the rate of progression of neoplasia to invasive cancer. CONCLUSIONS: In HIV-infected women, cervical cancer screening with annual Papanicolaou smears after two negative smears obtained 6 months apart offers quality-adjusted life expectancy benefits at a cost comparable to that of other clinical preventive interventions.;Ann Intern Med. 1999 Jan 19.130(2):97-107.;Goldie SJ1, Weinstein MC, Kuntz KM, Freedberg KA.;10068381;Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.,Algorithms,Colposcopy/economics*,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Disease Progression,Female,HIV Infections/complications*,HIV Infections/drug therapy,HIV Infections/economics,Health Care Costs/statistics & numerical data*,Humans,Markov Chains,Papanicolaou Test*,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,Time Factors,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/economics*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/etiology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/therapy,Vaginal Smears/economics*,R01-HS07317-01A1/HS/AHRQ HHS/United States;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.628"one",Determinants of cancer screening frequency: the example of screening for cervical cancer.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Cancer screening frequency should be based on the rate of progression of the disease and the sensitivity of the screening test. A common misconception is that a person's risk of getting the disease determines how often they should be screened. METHODS: We describe algebraically the theoretical interaction of disease progression rate and screening test sensitivity determining the portion of invasive cancers prevented by screening. After discussing the assumptions and limitations of the model, we apply this model to the example of screening for cervical cancer. Actual data from large screening programs assembled by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) are used to test the assumptions of the model. RESULTS: A simple formula can express the relation between disease progression rate, sensitivity of the screening test, screening frequency, and screening error. Disease prevalence does not figure in this equation. The IARC data suggest that, at least for cervical cancer, as screening frequency increases, incremental sensitivity of the test decreases or remaining undetected cases progress more rapidly so that anticipated benefits from more frequent screening are not realized. CONCLUSIONS: Rate of disease progression and sensitivity of the screening test are the proper determinants of cancer screening frequency. Because these factors can vary depending on screening frequency, however, the optimal screening interval for a particular cancer must be determined by clinical trials.;J Am Board Fam Pract. 1998 Mar-Apr.11(2):87-95.;Frame PS1, Frame JS.;9542700;Data Interpretation, Statistical,Disease Progression,Female,Humans,Mass Screening/methods,Mass Screening/statistics & numerical data*,Models, Statistical*,Sensitivity and Specificity,Time Factors,United States,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Vaginal Smears;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.324"not valid",Interactive neural-network-assisted screening. An economic assessment.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: To apply clinical effectiveness estimates of interactive, neural network-assisted (INNA) screening to economic cervical cancer screening models to assess the economic impact of using this technology. STUDY DESIGN: Estimates of the sensitivity of INNA screening were drawn from a recently completed comprehensive synthesis of the INNA literature and applied to the Computer Model for Designing CANcer ConTROL Programs-based Cervical Cancer Screen economic model. The economic analysis was conducted from a modified payer perspective using costs borne by payers combined with patient deductibles and copayments. Costs of treating cervical cancer were updated to 1997 values using the medical care component of the Consumer Price Index. The model was run for a cohort of women starting at age 20 and screened on a triennial schedule through age 75. RESULTS: In the primary analysis (sensitivity of unassisted manual examination assumed to be 85%), the ratios found in this investigation varied from approximately $35,000 to $80,000 per life year saved, with the preponderance of ratios < $50,000 per life year saved. These results were sensitive to estimates of sensitivity of unassisted manual screening but not to estimates of treatment costs. CONCLUSION: This investigation applied accuracy data on INNA rescreening to a model of the cost-effectiveness of cervical cancer screening. The results support the use of INNA rescreening as an appropriate expenditure of resources to identify missed cases of cervical epithelial abnormalities and potential cervical cancer.;Acta Cytol. 1998 Jan-Feb.42(1):246-52.;Radensky PW1, Mango LJ.;9479347;Adult,Aged,Carcinoma/classification,Carcinoma/diagnosis,Carcinoma/pathology,Carcinoma/prevention & control,Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/diagnosis,Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/pathology,Cervix Uteri/cytology*,Cohort Studies,Computer Simulation,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Costs and Cost Analysis,Female,Humans,Markov Chains,Mass Screening/economics*,Mass Screening/instrumentation,Mass Screening/methods,Microscopy,Middle Aged,Models, Economic*,Neural Networks (Computer)*,Sensitivity and Specificity,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/classification,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/pathology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Vaginal Smears/economics*,Vaginal Smears/instrumentation,Vaginal Smears/methods;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.568"one",Cost-effective analysis of mass screening for cervical cancer in Japan.;Abstract Cost-effectiveness analysis for cervical cancer screening in Japan was performed to estimate the cost per life-year saved by the screening. cost-effectiveness ratio (CER). The analysis was made using a simulation model to estimate long-term cost and effectiveness of the screening programs. CER of cervical cancer screening was estimated to be US$ 40,604 which was 2.4 times more expensive than that for gastric cancer screening but was about the same as that for colorectal cancer screening. It was within the range of cost-effectiveness of other cancer screening programs financed under the Health and Medical Services Law for the Aged in Japan. We performed sensitivity analysis on the following seven estimates, the screening charge, the sensitivity and the specificity of the screening test, the frequency of carcinoma in situ (CIS) among cases detected in the screening program, the initial cost and the terminal cost for patients with invasive cancer, and the incidence rate of cervical cancer. The sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the screening charge was the most influential factor on CER. CER was fairly stable under various assumptions on the accuracy of the screening test, the frequency of carcinoma in situ (CIS), the treatment cost for patient, and the incidence of cervical cancer. CER was less sensitive to the changes in incidence, even to as low as a 50% decrease of the current figure. Then if the incidence rate becomes 85% of the current figure in 2015, CER would be US$ 48,176 and it was suggested that the cervical cancer screening would remain reasonably cost-effective until the year 2015.;J Epidemiol. 1997 Sep.7(3):135-41.;Matsunaga G1, Tsuji I, Sato S, Fukao A, Hisamichi S, Yajima A.;9337511;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Carcinoma in Situ/economics,Carcinoma in Situ/epidemiology,Carcinoma in Situ/prevention & control*,Cohort Studies,Computer Simulation,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Female,Humans,Japan/epidemiology,Mass Screening/economics*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/economics,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Vaginal Smears/economics*;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.568"one",Cost-effectiveness of rescreening conventionally prepared cervical smears by PAPNET testing.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: This study explored the cost-effectiveness of the use of PAPNET testing-supplemental, neural network-based testing used to increase the accuracy of cervical smear screening practice. STUDY DESIGN: Using a model adapted from one developed under contract from the United States Congress Office of Technology Assessment to evaluate cost-effectiveness of cervical cancer screening in elderly women, the study evaluated U.S. women aged 20-64. The study reviewed various screening intervals and examined the course of follow-up (i.e., repeat abnormal smear vs. immediate colposcopy) to offer a range into which most routine medical practice will fall. RESULTS: Assuming a false negative rate of 25% for low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL) and 15% for high grade SIL and applying increased sensitivity of 30% from PAPNET, we can expect a cost of $48,474 per life-year saved among biennially screened women. For women screened triennially, as recommended by most groups, the cost per life-year saved is $25,185.

Conclusions derived from the models often are model and data dependent. Several authors have used simplified models and unrealistic assumptions, such as the failure to differentiate between different grades of dysplasia, or 100% sensitivity for the screening test. The Markov process assumes that the rate of transfer between states is independent of the duration of time spent in one state, and this assumption may be unsound. The difficulty with all models is in interpreting the appropriateness of the parameter values. Some are well documented, for example, stage-specific survival rates for treated patients or attendance for screening. Many, however, cannot be given a fixed value. The large number of factors that appear implicated in the incidence of and mortality from cervical cancer can lead to many feasible sets of parameter values that generate output that approaches the observed data.;Clin Obstet Gynecol. 1995 Sep.38(3):577-84.;Wilson S1, Woodman C.;8612367;Review,Case-Control Studies,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Female,Humans,Incidence,Markov Chains,Mass Screening/economics,Mass Screening/methods*,Sensitivity and Specificity,Survival Rate,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.356"not valid",Cost-effectiveness of cervical cytologic examination during pregnancy.;Abstract BACKGROUND: We undertook a study to determine the cost-effectiveness of performing routine cervical cytologic examination during pregnancy. METHODS: The costs generated by doing routine prenatal cervical cytologic examination were calculated based on chart review in a family practice setting. A consecutive sample of 523 patients giving birth during 1990 was used. Analysis was done on 423 of those patients with prenatal Papanicolaou smear results recorded. Cost savings from detection of curable disease and utility of the test in terms of well-years saved were calculated from published statistics using a single-step Markov process to model the population at risk. RESULTS: For patients of all ages using a discount rate of 5 percent, the cost generated by prenatal cervical cytologic examination was $146,400 per well-year of life saved. Age stratification showed cost per well-year to range from $321,600 for patients aged 15 to 19 years to $48,800 for those aged 35 to 39 years. CONCLUSIONS: Routine prenatal cervical cytologic examination is significantly less cost-effective than the most commonly done medical procedures. If medical funding is limited, elimination of this test should be considered for women with normal findings on cervical cytologic examinations within the previous 2 to 3 years.;J Am Board Fam Pract. 1993 Nov-Dec.6(6):537-45.;Carter PM1, Coburn TC, Luszczak M.;8285092;Adolescent,Adult,Age Distribution,Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/economics,Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/epidemiology,Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/pathology,Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/prevention & control*,Cost Savings,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Family Practice,Female,Humans,Life Expectancy,Markov Chains,Mass Screening/economics*,Models, Econometric,Neoplasm Staging,Papanicolaou Test*,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Complications, Neoplastic/economics,Pregnancy Complications, Neoplastic/epidemiology,Pregnancy Complications, Neoplastic/pathology,Pregnancy Complications, Neoplastic/prevention & control*,Prenatal Care/economics*,Prevalence,Risk Factors,Sampling Studies,Sensitivity and Specificity,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/economics,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/pathology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Vaginal Smears/economics*,Value of Life;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.516"not valid",Cervical cancer and health care resources in Newark, New Jersey, 1970 to 1988.;Abstract OBJECTIVES: In the past, the predominantly Black population of Newark, NJ, had little access to programs promoting or providing Pap tests. The ratio of in situ to invasive cases of cervical carcinoma was markedly reduced in all age categories, indicating inadequate screening for this cancer in this population. Funding became available to provide and publicize Pap smears but ceased after 5.5 years. We examined the effect of these changes in funding. METHODS: Data came from all Newark hospitals and practitioners and from the state cancer registry. There are now data on incidence of in situ and invasive cervical cancer in Newark from 1970 through 1988, including years before, during, and after program funding. RESULTS: The ratio of in situ to invasive cervical cancer increased and decreased in a striking parallel with the provision and subsequent cessation of funding. CONCLUSIONS: Cessation of funding of education and screening programs can result in resumption of an unfavorable in situ/invasive cervical carcinoma ratio in a poor population.;Am J Public Health. 1993 Jan.83(1):45-8.;Holland BK1, Foster JD, Louria DB.;8417605;Adolescent,Adult,African Americans,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Carcinoma/epidemiology,Carcinoma/ethnology*,Carcinoma/prevention & control*,Carcinoma in Situ/epidemiology,Carcinoma in Situ/ethnology,Carcinoma in Situ/prevention & control,Child,Costs and Cost Analysis,European Continental Ancestry Group,Female,Health Education*/economics,Health Services Accessibility/economics*,Health Services Accessibility/trends,Humans,Incidence,Linear Models,Mass Screening*/economics,Middle Aged,Neoplasm Invasiveness,New Jersey/epidemiology,Papanicolaou Test,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/ethnology*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Vaginal Smears/economics;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.3"not valid",Cost effectiveness of cervical cancer screening for the elderly.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: To analyze the costs and benefits of alternative cervical cancer screening schedules among elderly women. SETTING: Population-based screening programs. DESIGN: A Markov model predicts the outcomes of periodic screening, diagnosis, and treatment for cervical cancer among women from 65 to 109 years of age. PATIENTS: A hypothetical cohort of one million 65-year-old women. representative of the U.S. population. MEASUREMENTS: The costs and yields of screening. RESULTS: Triennial screening reduced mortality from cervical cancer among the elderly by 74% at a cost of $2254 per year of life saved. Annual screening increased costs to $7345 per year of life saved. less frequent schedules yielded lower costs but decreased savings in life. These results were most sensitive to the quality of the Papanicolaou smear and the characteristics of the women using the benefit. If the sensitivity of the Papanicolaou smear was reduced from a baseline estimate of 75% to 50% and the specificity was decreased to 87% from 95%, the cost effectiveness ratio increased by nearly $7000 per year of life saved. If triennial screening is targeted to women who have not had regular screening, the program will save money as well as years of life. however, screening women who have been screened regularly is considerably less efficient, increasing costs to $33,572 per year of life saved. CONCLUSION: The success of the new Medicare benefit depends substantially on physicians assuring that their elderly patients, particularly women without regular prior screening, obtain high quality Papanicolaou smears. The data also show that after a woman 65 years of age or older has a history of regular negative smears, screening is inefficient and can cease.;Ann Intern Med. 1992 Sep 15.117(6):520-7.;Fahs MC1, Mandelblatt J, Schechter C, Muller C.;1503355;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Cohort Studies,Cost-Benefit Analysis*,Female,Humans,Mass Screening/economics*,Medicare/economics,Models, Statistical,Sensitivity and Specificity,United States,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/economics,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Value of Life,J3-4130.0/PHS HHS/United States;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.58"one",Optimization of cervical cancer screening.;Abstract The aim of this study was to investigate how a screening program interacts with the dynamic natural history of cervical neoplasia in order to learn how screening for cervical cancer should be carried out most cost-effectively. For the purpose of optimization, the fundamental quantities of the natural history are the shape of the curve of age-specific prevalence rates of cancer in situ, and the duration of this stage before progression to invasive cancer. Since these quantities seem similar in different populations, the results probably can be generalized. Simulation studies revealed that optimal screening implies a nonperiodic schedule, and that this schedule is dependent not only on the number of screenings, but also on the efficiency of the screening rounds. With lower efficiency, the schedule should be concentrated into a shorter period. The effect of screening is also especially sensitive to the choice of age at the first and--to a smaller extent--last screening. The results concerning three different objectives also were compared, namely reduction of the cumulative number of invasive cancers, reduction of deaths due to cervical cancer, and reduction of years-of-life lost. The choice of objective also plays a role in the design of an optimal screening program. The theoretical approach in this analysis easily can be developed and accommodated to more complex individual situations such as prior screening histories and differing screening schedules in high- and low-risk women.;Cancer Causes Control. 1992 Mar.3(2):125-36.;Gustafsson L1, Adami HO.;1562702;Adult,Age Factors,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Carcinoma in Situ/epidemiology,Carcinoma in Situ/prevention & control,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Female,Humans,Incidence,Life Expectancy,Mass Screening/economics,Mass Screening/methods*,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical,Precancerous Conditions/epidemiology,Precancerous Conditions/prevention & control,Prevalence,Risk Factors,Sensitivity and Specificity,Sweden/epidemiology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.468"not valid",Epidemiological evidence for age-dependent regression of pre-invasive cervical cancer.;Abstract Data from the screening programme in British Columbia are used to test hypotheses about the natural history of cervical cancer, especially about progression and regression of preclinical lesions (dysplasia and carcinoma in situ). Three models are considered. A model without regression does not give an adequate fit of the data (P less than 0.001), and results in an implausible estimate of 33 years for the mean duration of pre-invasive lesions. A model with an equal regression rate at all ages still does not result in a good reproduction of the data. A good fit is achieved for a model with different regression rates in lesions that develop under and over age 34. Under age 34, 84% of the new lesions will regress spontaneously, with a 95% confidence interval of 76-92% regression. Over age 34, we estimate that 40% of the new lesions will regress. The average duration of dysplasia + CIS is 11.8 years, and the sensitivity of the Pap-smear is 80%. It is concluded that a considerable proportion of pre-invasive lesions in young women do not progress. The findings about progression and duration of pre-invasive lesions do not support the still prevailing tendency of frequently making Pap smears in young women.;Br J Cancer. 1991 Sep.64(3):559-65.;van Oortmarssen GJ1, Habbema JD.;1911199;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Age Factors,Aged,British Columbia,Cohort Studies,Female,Humans,Incidence,Mass Screening,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical,Neoplasm Invasiveness,Neoplasm Regression, Spontaneous*,Papanicolaou Test,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/pathology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control,Vaginal Smears;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.24"one",Screening for cervical cancer.;Abstract Indirect evidence indicates that cervical cancer screening should reduce the incidence and mortality of invasive cervical cancer by about 90%. In the absence of screening, a 20-year-old average-risk woman has about a 250 in 10,000 chance of developing invasive cervical cancer during the rest of her life, and about a 118 in 10,000 chance of dying from it. Screening at least every 3 years from 20 to 75 years of age will decrease these probabilities by about 215 in 10,000 and 107 in 10,000, respectively, and will increase a 20-year-old woman's life expectancy by about 96 days. The particular age at which screening is begun (for example, 17 or 20 years), the requirement of several initial annual examinations before reducing the frequency, and screening every 1 or 2 years compared with every 3 years improves the effectiveness by less than 5%. Screening is recommended at least every 3 years from about age 20 to about age 65 years.;Ann Intern Med. 1990 Aug 1.113(3):214-26.;Eddy DM1.;2115753;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Review,Adult,Age Factors,Aged,Case-Control Studies,Cost-Benefit Analysis,False Negative Reactions,Female,Humans,Incidence,Mass Screening*/economics,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical,Neoplasm Invasiveness,Risk Factors,United States/epidemiology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/mortality,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control,Vaginal Smears/economics,Vaginal Smears/standards;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.388"one",Cytologic screening for cancer of the uterine cervix in Sweden evaluated by identification and simulation.;Abstract Parameters characterising the progression of cervical neoplasia were estimated from population-based cancer and mortality statistics in Sweden for 1958-1981 by means of a dynamic computer model. Proceeding from that model and these data, the incidence and prevalence curves were constructed, the effects of the extensive cytological screening measures introduced during the 1960s were assessed, and future gains due to the measures already undertaken up to 1981 could be simulated. About 4,000 cases of cancer in situ were diagnosed annually in Sweden after the end of the 1960s, most of them in women born later than 1919. The maximum reduction in the number of invasive cancers up to 1981 was 42% for women born in 1919-1923, but increased progressively for later birth cohorts and reached 69% for those born in 1934-1938. The corresponding reduction in mortality rates was of the same magnitude. The screening measures up to 1981 will ultimately result in a reduction of invasive cancer by about 12,500 cases and of the number of deaths due to this disease by about 4,100. Only a part of the total gain in the number of lives saved had been revealed at the end of the study period in 1981.;Br J Cancer. 1990 Jun.61(6):903-8.;Gustafsson L1, Adami HO.;2372495;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Age Factors,Carcinoma in Situ/epidemiology,Carcinoma in Situ/mortality,Carcinoma in Situ/pathology,Carcinoma in Situ/prevention & control*,Female,Humans,Mass Screening*,Middle Aged,Prevalence,Program Evaluation,Sweden/epidemiology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/mortality,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/pathology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Vaginal Smears*/statistics & numerical data;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.192"valid",Modelling the implications for hospital services of cervical cytology screening: a case history.;Abstract A screening programme is being introduced throughout the UK to reduce deaths from cancer of the cervix by early detection of precancerous lesions.

Using a computer simulation model, the outcomes expected from those policies had they been implemented over a 30 year period (1961-90) have been examined. The original policies based on five-yearly testing of women aged over 35 appear to be the most cost-effective, and extension of screening to younger age groups leads to loss of efficiency. Attempts to use non-screening health care contacts in order to take cervical smears (eg, during pregnancy, family planning, at gynaecology clinics) produce few advantages and considerably complicate the establishment of regular testing for the individual. The achievement of higher attendance rates is as important to the outcome of screening as concentration on more intensive or complex policies.;J Epidemiol Community Health. 1986 Jun.40(2):143-53.;Parkin DM, Moss SM.;3746177;Adult,Aged,Computers,England,Evaluation Studies as Topic,Female,Health Policy*/economics,Humans,Mass Screening/economics,Mass Screening/organization & administration*,Middle Aged,Models, Theoretical,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/mortality,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Wales;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.332"one",A computer simulation model for the practical planning of cervical cancer screening programmes.;Abstract There is ample evidence of the efficacy of cytological screening in the prevention of cervical cancer but disagreement on the form which screening programmes should take. Simulation models have been used as a convenient and rapid method of exploring the outcome of different screening policies and of demonstrating the importance and interrelationships of the variables concerned. However, most such models are either too abstract or too simplistic to be of practical value in planning screening programmes. A model is described which reproduces demographic events in a female population (that of England and Wales) over a 30 year period, and onto this superimposes the natural history of cervical carcinoma, using data derived from published studies. A microsimulation approach--each individual in the population being retained as a unit--allows factors such as disease onset and screening uptake to be dependent upon personal characteristics and past events. Screening can be offered as part of a routine programme, or incidentally--for example during pregnancy or hospital attendance. The model allows quantitative evaluation of the complex patterns of screening that are actually observed and the relative importance of the different components of such screening programmes. Assumptions about natural history can thus be studied.;Br J Cancer. 1985 Apr.51(4):551-68.;Parkin DM.;3978033;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adolescent,Adult,Aged,Carcinoma in Situ/prevention & control,Computers*,England,Female,Humans,Mass Screening/methods*,Middle Aged,Models, Theoretical*,Patient Acceptance of Health Care,Uterine Cervical Dysplasia/prevention & control,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/mortality,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Wales;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.38"one",Cost analysis of screening for, diagnosing, and staging prostate cancer based on a systematic review of published studies.;Abstract INTRODUCTION: The reported estimates of the economic costs associated with prostate cancer screening, diagnostic testing, and clinical staging are substantial. However, the resource costs (i.e., factors such as physician's time, laboratory tests, patient's time away from work) included in these estimates are unknown. We examined the resource costs for prostate cancer screening, diagnostic tests, and staging. examined how these costs differ in the United States from costs in other industrialized countries. and estimated the cost per man screened for prostate cancer, per man given a diagnostic test, and per man given a clinically staged diagnosis of this disease. METHODS: We searched the electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL for articles and reports on prostate cancer published from January 1980 through December 2003. Studies were selected according to the following criteria: the article was published in English. the full text was available for review. the study reported the resource or input cost data used to estimate the cost of prostate cancer testing, diagnosing, or clinical staging. and the study was conducted in an established market economy. We used descriptive statistics, weighted mean, and Monte Carlo simulation methods to pool and analyze the abstracted data. RESULTS: Of 262 studies examined, 28 met our selection criteria (15 from the United States and 13 from other industrialized countries). For studies conducted in the United States, the pooled baseline resource cost was $37.23 for screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and $31.77 for screening with digital rectal examination (DRE). For studies conducted in other industrialized countries, the pooled baseline resource cost was $30.92 for screening with PSA and $33.54 for DRE. For diagnostic and staging methods, the variation in the resource costs between the United States and other industrialized countries was mixed. CONCLUSION: Because national health resources are limited, a decision about whether to invest in early detection of prostate cancer requires an understanding of the factors included in estimates of the economic cost of this disease. This study may benefit health policy makers charged with allocating resources for prostate cancer.;Prev Chronic Dis. 2007 Oct.4(4):A100.

METHODS: The cost per life-year saved (cost-effectiveness ratio. CER) was compared between PC screening and other 5 already established cancer screenings in Japan by an analytical simulation model to estimate cost and effectiveness of various screening programs, which was proposed recently by Hisamichi and Kamae. RESULTS: Although CER in PC screening amounted 204 x 10(3) yen for males aged from 55 to 59 years of age, among males more than 60 years of age. CER became negative, which meant a positive balance might be obtained economically by the adoption of screening. CER of PC screening was similar to that of colorectal cancer screening, while was 2 to 14 times lower than that of the remaining 4 established cancer screenings. According to the sensitivity analysis, the rate of the prevalence of PC, as well as the rate of the examinees for the secondary study influenced remarkedly the cost-effectiveness of PC screening. CONCLUSION: The morbidity and mortality of PC has seriously increased in the past years in Japan and the number of PC patients in 2015 is anticipated to show a 5.19-fold increase of that in 1990. According to such considerable increase of PC patients in the near future, PC screening is thought to be an economically well-balanced public activity.;Nihon Hinyokika Gakkai Zasshi. 1997 Oct.88(10):892-9.;Nakagawa S1, Ebisui K, Sugimoto K, Nakanishi H, Kanemitsu N, Watanabe H.;9388370;English Abstract,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Aged,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Humans,Japan,Male,Mass Screening/economics*,Middle Aged,National Health Programs*,Prostatic Neoplasms/economics*,Prostatic Neoplasms/prevention & control;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Prostatic Neoplasms;;model valid;0.656"not valid",What is a screening test? Misclassification bias in observational studies of screening for cancer.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the importance of accurately identifying clinical distinctions of subjects in observational studies of screening. DESIGN: Simulated case-control studies. SETTING: The West Haven Veterans Affairs Medical Center. PATIENTS: Fifty-two men diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1988 or 1989 had 252 digital rectal examinations (DREs) in the preceding 5 years. A classification scheme used patient symptoms and the results of prior DREs to assign the last DRE before the diagnosis of cancer to one of the following categories: definite screening, likely screening, probable screening, not screening, or other and unknown. Sixty-five percent of the DREs were classified as definite or likely screening, and another 15% were classified as probable screening. MAIN RESULTS: Changing the definition of a screening DRE from one including to one excluding probable DREs lowered the frequency of screening in case subjects more than it did in case controls, and thus lowered the odds ratio (OR), making screening appear to be more protective. Even when DRE was not protective, the ORs for the effectiveness of screening with the more restrictive definition ranged from 0.21 to 0.83 in 36 simulated case-control studies that differed according to the frequency of screening, the prevalence of cancer in case controls, and the extent of misclassification error. CONCLUSIONS: If clinical distinctions in the performance of screening tests are not classified appropriately, observational studies will misrepresent the proportion of subjects exposed to screening interventions and produce biased results.;J Gen Intern Med. 1997 Oct.12(10):607-12.;Concato J1.;9346456;Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Bias,Case-Control Studies,Epidemiologic Methods,Humans,Incidence,Male,Mass Screening/methods*,Mass Screening/standards,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical,Observer Variation,Odds Ratio,Palpation*/utilization,Predictive Value of Tests,Prostatic Neoplasms/diagnosis,Prostatic Neoplasms/epidemiology,Prostatic Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Rectum,Sensitivity and Specificity,Survival Rate;Primary Prevention, Early Detection of Cancer, Prostatic Neoplasms;;model valid;0.196"one",Prostate cancer screening: a decision analysis.;Abstract BACKGROUND: The issue of whether to screen men for prostate cancer is controversial. No randomized clinical trials have been completed to confirm the efficacy of screening for prostate cancer. We created a mathematical model of the clinical risks and benefits of screening for prostate cancer. METHODS: A Markov decision-analytic model evaluated the outcomes of annually screening asymptomatic men for prostate cancer beginning at age 50 years. The screening and testing algorithm included the digital rectal examination, transrectal ultrasound, and prostate-specific antigen test. A sample of 10 male patients with no history of prostate disease were interviewed to assess their utilities (preferences) regarding the various adverse outcomes of prostate cancer treatment. RESULTS: The model indicated that no screening was preferred to screening when patients' utilities were considered (24.14 vs 23.47 quality-adjusted life years expected). The optimal decision was sensitive to the utilities of impotence and urethral stricture, the most common adverse outcomes for patients under the age of 65 years. When adverse outcomes of treatment were ignored, screening was favored (24.86 vs 24.22 years of life expectancy.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the life expectancy (LE) and differences in survival offered by active surveillance, risk-reducing chemoprevention, and bilateral prophylactic mastectomy among women with LCIS. METHODS: A Markov simulation model was constructed to determine average LE and quality-adjusted LE (QALE) gains for hypothetical cohorts of women diagnosed with LCIS at various ages under alternative risk-reduction strategies. Probabilities for invasive breast cancer, breast cancer-specific mortality, other-cause mortality and the effectiveness of preventive strategies were derived from published studies and from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. RESULTS: Assuming a breast cancer incidence from 1.02% to 1.37% per year under active surveillance, a woman aged 50 years diagnosed with LCIS would have a total LE of 32.78 years and would gain 0.13 years (1.6 months) in LE by adding chemoprevention and 0.25 years (3.0 months) in LE by adding bilateral prophylactic mastectomy. After quality adjustment, chemoprevention resulted in the greatest QALE for women ages 40 to 60 years at LCIS diagnosis, whereas surveillance remained the preferred strategy for optimizing QALE among women diagnosed at age 65 years and older. CONCLUSIONS: In this model, among women with a diagnosis of LCIS, breast cancer prevention strategies only modestly affected overall survival, whereas chemoprevention was modeled as the preferred management strategy for optimizing invasive disease-free survival while prolonging QALE form women younger than 65 years.

We compared quality-adjusted survival after contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM) with surveillance only (no CPM) among women with breast cancer incorporating the degree of family history. METHODS: We created a microsimulation model for women with first-degree, second-degree, and no family history treated for a stage I, II, or III estrogen receptor (ER)-positive or ER-negative breast cancer at the ages of 40, 50, 60, and 70. The model incorporated a 10-year posttreatment period for risk of developing CBC and/or dying of the primary cancer or CBC. For each patient profile, we used 100,000 microsimulation trials to estimate quality-adjusted life expectancy for the clinical strategies CPM and no CPM. RESULTS: CPM showed minimal improvement on quality-adjusted life expectancy among women age 50-60 with no or a unilateral first-degree or second-degree family history (decreasing from 0.31 to -0.06 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs)) and was unfavorable for most subgroups of women age 70 with stage III breast cancer regardless of degree of family history (range -0.08 to -0.02 QALYs). Sensitivity analysis showed that the highest predicted benefit of CPM assuming 95 % risk reduction in CBC was 0.57 QALYs for a 40-year-old woman with stage I breast cancer who had a first-degree relative with bilateral breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Women age 40 with stage I breast cancer and a first-degree relative with bilateral breast cancer have a QALY benefit from CPM similar to that reported for BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. For most subgroups of women, CPM has a minimal to no effect on quality-adjusted life expectancy, irrespective of family history of breast cancer.;Breast Cancer Res. 2016 Sep 20.18(1):93. doi: 10.1186/s13058-016-0752-y.;Davies KR1, Brewster AM2, Bedrosian I3, Parker PA4, Crosby MA5, Peterson SK6, Shen Y7, Volk RJ1, Cantor SB8.;27650678;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Aged,Biomarkers, Tumor,Breast Neoplasms/mortality*,Breast Neoplasms/pathology,Breast Neoplasms/surgery*,Clinical Decision-Making,Female,Humans,Life Expectancy,Markov Chains,Middle Aged,Neoplasm Staging,Patient Outcome Assessment,Population Surveillance,Probability,Prophylactic Mastectomy*,Quality of Life,Risk Factors,Tumor Burden,Biomarkers, Tumor,P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;Primary Prevention, Combined Modality Therapy, Breast Neoplasms;;model valid;0.256"not valid",Clinical Outcomes and Cost-effectiveness of Primary Prophylaxis of Febrile Neutropenia During Adjuvant Docetaxel and Cyclophosphamide Chemotherapy for Breast Cancer.;Abstract Docetaxel and cyclophosphamide (TC) is a widely used breast cancer adjuvant regimen. We sought to compare the rates of febrile neutropenia (FN) between patients receiving no primary prophylaxis (PP) and those receiving PP with either granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) or antibiotics. We also analyzed cost-effectiveness of TC with and without either G-CSF or antibiotics. Charts were reviewed of all 340 patients who received adjuvant TC between January 2008 and December 2012 at two major cancer centers. Rates of FN in the three groups - no PP, PP with G-CSF and PP with antibiotics were compared. A Markov model was constructed comparing cost-effectiveness of PP with G-CSF, PP with antibiotics, and secondary prophylaxis (SP) with G-CSF after an episode of FN in a previous cycle. Costs were based on actual resource utilization and supplemented by the published literature, adjusted to 2012 Canadian dollars. Of the 73 (21%) patients who did not receive any PP, 23 (32%) of patients developed FN. Of the 192 (57%) patients receiving PP with G-CSF alone, only two (1%. p < 0.0001) developed FN. and of the 53 (16%) receiving PP with antibiotics alone, six (11%. p < 0.01) developed FN. From a cost-standpoint, PP with G-CSF was less cost-effective than PP with antibiotics. The rate of FN with TC chemotherapy exceeds 30%, and American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines recommend PP with G-CSF in this situation. PP with antibiotics is more cost-effective, and is a reasonable option in resource-limited settings or for patients who decline or do not tolerate G-CSF.;Breast J. 2015 Nov-Dec.21(6):658-64. doi: 10.1111/tbj.12501.

The objective of this study is to examine the impact of CPM on life expectancy (LE) and quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) in women with sporadic unilateral breast cancer. A Markov model was developed to compare 18 hypothetical cohorts of 45-year-old women with newly diagnosed unilateral, sporadic breast cancer treated with or without CPM. The probability of developing distant metastases by American Joint Committee on Cancer stage and molecular subtype was derived from British Columbia Cancer Agency data. Additional model parameters were identified from the medical literature. Sensitivity analyses were performed to examine the impact of plausible variations in key model parameters on results. CPM improved LE in all cohorts (range 0.06-0.54 years). Stage had more effect on LE than subtype (stage I mean, 0.44 years, stage III mean, 0.11 years). However, after adjusting for quality-of-life, No CPM was favored in all cohorts. Univariate sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the most influential model parameter was the post-CPM health state utility. The preferred strategy shifted from No CPM to CPM when the post-CPM utility exceeded 0.83 (base case value 0.81). PSA indicated that LE gains and QALE decreases were stable in all cohorts. The primary determinant of survival after unilateral breast cancer is stage at diagnosis. Our results suggest that routine CPM would not improve quality-adjusted survival for the majority of women with unilateral sporadic breast cancer.;Breast Cancer Res Treat. 2015 Jul.152(1):217-226. doi: 10.1007/s10549-015-3462-8.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the magnitude of the survival benefit of CPM for women with unilateral breast cancer. METHODS: We developed a Markov model to simulate survival outcomes after CPM and no CPM among women with stage I or II breast cancer without a BRCA mutation. Probabilities for developing contralateral breast cancer (CBC), dying from CBC, dying from primary breast cancer, and age-specific mortality rates were estimated from published studies. We estimated life expectancy (LE) gain, 20-year overall survival, and disease-free survival with each intervention strategy among cohorts of women defined by age, estrogen receptor (ER) status, and stage of cancer. RESULTS: Predicted LE gain from CPM ranged from 0.13 to 0.59 years for women with stage I breast cancer and 0.08 to 0.29 years for those with stage II breast cancer. Absolute 20-year survival differences ranged from 0.56% to 0.94% for women with stage I breast cancer and 0.36% to 0.61% for women with stage II breast cancer. CPM was more beneficial among younger women, stage I, and ER-negative breast cancer. Sensitivity analyses yielded a maximum 20-year survival difference with CPM of only 1.45%. CONCLUSIONS: The absolute 20-year survival benefit from CPM was less than 1% among all age, ER status, and cancer stage groups. Estimates of LE gains and survival differences derived from decision models may provide more realistic expectations of CPM. � The Author 2014. Published by Oxford University Press.

METHODS: Using a Markov model, we estimated the cost-effectiveness of no RT, EBRT, and IMRT over 10 years. We estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of IMRT compared with EBRT under different scenarios to determine the necessary improvement in effectiveness for newer modalities to be cost-effective. We estimated model inputs using women in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database fulfilling the Cancer and Leukemia Group B C9343 trial criteria. RESULTS: The incremental cost of EBRT compared with no RT was $9500 with an ICER of $44600 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. The ICERs increased with age, ranging from $38300 (age 70-74 years) to $55800 (age 80 to 94 years) per QALY. The ICERs increased to more than $63800 per QALY for women aged 70 to 74 years with an expected 10-year survival of 25%. Reduction in local recurrence by IMRT compared with EBRT did not have a substantial impact on the ICER of IMRT. IMRT would have to increase the utility of baseline state by 20% to be cost-effective (<$100000 per QALY). CONCLUSIONS: EBRT is cost-effective for older women with favorable risk breast cancer, but substantially less cost-effective for women with shorter expected survival. Newer RT modalities would have to be substantially more effective than existing therapies in improving quality of life to be cost-effective.;J Natl Cancer Inst. 2014 Mar.106(3):dju008. doi: 10.1093/jnci/dju008.

METHODS: A Markov model was used to compare PP vs SP with pegfilgrastim in a cohort of patients receiving six cycles of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and prednisone (CHOP) or CHOP plus rituximab (CHOP-R) chemotherapy. Model inputs, including efficacy of pegfilgrastim in reducing risk of FN and costs, were estimated from publicly available sources and peer-reviewed publications. Incremental cost-effectiveness was evaluated in terms of net cost per life-year saved (LYS), per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, and per FN event avoided over a lifetime horizon. Deterministic and probabilistic analyses were performed to assess sensitivity and robustness of results. RESULTS: Lifetime costs for PP were $5000 greater than for SP. however, PP was associated with fewer FN events and more LYs and QALYs gained vs SP. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for PP vs SP for CHOP were $13,400 per FN event avoided, $29,500 per QALY gained, and $25,800 per LYS. CHOP-R results were similar ($15,000 per FN event avoided, $33,000 per QALY gained, and $28,900 per LYS). Results were most sensitive to baseline FN risk, cost per FN episode, and odds ratio for reduced relative dose intensity due to prior FN event. PP was cost-effective vs SP in 85% of simulations at a $50,000 per QALY threshold. LIMITATIONS: In the absence of NHL-specific data, estimates for pegfilgrastim efficacy and relative risk reduction of FN were based on available data for neoadjuvant TAC in patients with breast cancer. Baseline risks of FN for CHOP and CHOP-R were assumed to be equivalent.

Little is known, however, about the value patients place on avoiding various aspects of CINV. The current study helps fill this gap in the literature. METHODS: 301 patients completed a discrete-choice conjoint survey. Patients viewed 25 conjoint tasks, each containing two descriptions of CINV, and indicated which they preferred. The descriptions combined levels from eight CINV attributes (likelihood of nausea, duration of nausea, severity of nausea, likelihood of vomiting, duration of vomiting, severity of vomiting, need to seek treatment for dehydration, and out-of-pocket treatment costs). RESULTS: Cost contributed more to patient choices than any other single attribute. The combined effect of the likelihood, duration, and severity attributes for nausea, however, was a stronger driver of patient choices than cost, as was the combined effect of the likelihood, duration, and severity attributes for vomiting. The nausea attributes also were a stronger driver of patient choices than the vomiting attributes. Patients were willing to pay to avoid increases in all attributes, except likelihood of vomiting, where the result was not statistically different from zero. Willingness-to-pay varied by income, disease stage, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, chemotherapy status, and whether patients worked while on chemotherapy. LIMITATIONS: Although the study used a convenience sample, data were collected from several geographically dispersed U.S. oncology clinics. CONCLUSIONS: Several antiemetics are now available at different price points. This study assesses the value patients place on their benefits and may be used to inform decisions about the management of CINV.;J Med Econ. 2013 Oct.16(10):1179-89. doi: 10.3111/13696998.2013.832257.

Current scrutiny of the medical costs led us to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of CPM versus routine surveillance as an alternative contralateral breast cancer (CBC) risk management strategy. METHODS: Using a Markov model, we simulated patients with breast cancer from mastectomy to death. Model parameters were gathered from published literature or national databases. Base-case analysis focused on patients with average-risk breast cancer, 45 years of age at treatment. Outcomes were valued in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Patients' age, risk level of breast cancer, and quality of life (QOL) were varied to assess their impact on results. RESULTS: Mean costs of treatment for women age 45 years are comparable: $36,594 for the CPM and $35,182 for surveillance. CPM provides 21.22 mean QALYs compared with 20.93 for surveillance, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $4,869/QALY gained for CPM. To prevent one CBC, six CPMs would be needed. CPM is no longer cost-effective for patients older than 70 years (ICER $62,750/QALY). For BRCA-positive patients, CPM is clearly cost-effective, providing more QALYs while being less costly. In non-BRCA patients, cost-effectiveness of CPM is highly dependent on assumptions regarding QOL for CPM versus surveillance strategy. CONCLUSION: CPM is cost-effective compared with surveillance for patients with breast cancer who are younger than 70 years. Results are sensitive to BRCA-positive status and assumptions of QOL differences between CPM and surveillance patients. This highlights the importance of tailoring treatment for individual patients.;J Clin Oncol. 2011 Aug 1.29(22):2993-3000. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2011.35.6956.

Zoledronic acid (ZOL) prevents aromatase inhibitor-associated bone loss (AIBL) in postmenopausal women with BC. This analysis assessed the cost-effectiveness of ZOL for prevention of fractures in postmenopausal women with BC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov model was developed to project lifetime incidence of fractures, quality-adjusted life years (QALY), and costs as a function of bone mineral density (BMD) for women with early-stage BC receiving letrozole alone or with ZOL. Two strategies of ZOL therapy were compared with no treatment: starting ZOL treatment only when BMD levels decreased ('delayed ZOL') and starting ZOL simultaneously with letrozole therapy ('upfront ZOL'). RESULTS: Delayed ZOL therapy was estimated to cost 16,069 pounds per QALY, when compared with not administering bisphosphonates for AIBL prevention. The corresponding cost per QALY gained for upfront ZOL versus no treatment was estimated at 21,973 pounds. The cost-effectiveness ratio for upfront versus delayed therapy was estimated at 24,868 pounds per QALY gained. CONCLUSION: Both delayed and upfront therapy with ZOL for the prevention of AIBL and fractures in BC patients in the UK appear to result in highly acceptable cost-effectiveness ratios.;Ann Oncol. 2010 Jul.21(7):1529-36. doi: 10.1093/annonc/mdp560.

This study aims to evaluate cost-effectiveness of these agents under Japan's health system. A cost-effectiveness analysis with Markov model consisting of eight health states such as healthy, invasive breast cancer, and endometrial cancer is carried out. The model incorporated the findings of National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project P-1 and P-2 trial, and key costs obtained from health insurance claim reviews. Favourable results, that is cost saving or cost-effective, are found by both tamoxifen and raloxifene for the introduction of chemoprevention among extremely high-risk women such as having a history of atypical hyperplasia, a history of lobular carcinoma in situ or a 5-year predicted breast cancer risk of > or =5.01% starting at younger age, whereas unfavourable results, that is 'cost more and gain less' or cost-ineffective, are found for women with a 5-year predicted breast cancer risk of < or =5.00%. Therapeutic policy switch from tamoxifen to raloxifene among postmenopausal women are implied cost-effective. Findings suggest that introduction of chemoprevention targeting extremely high-risk women in Japan can be justifiable as an efficient use of finite health-care resources, possibly contributing to cost containment.;Br J Cancer. 2009 Jan 27.100(2):281-90. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6604869.

METHODS: A standard health economic Markov model estimated the cost and outcome for node-positive early breast cancer patients, from initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy to death. Patient-level data were used from the Breast Cancer International Research Group (BCIRG) 001 trial for estimates of the effect of chemotherapy on toxicity and outcome, and an observational data set collected from a UK university hospital provided estimates of resource use and outcome for patients with relapsed disease. RESULTS: Over a 10-year analysis timeframe, the incremental cost per life-year saved associated with the use of TAC rather than FAC was estimated as pound 15,418 (95% CI, pound 13,734 to pound 17,997) and the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained (IC/QALY) was pound 18,188 (95% CI, pound 14,161 to pound 32,422). The addition of primary G-CSF (lenograstim or filgrastim) to the TAC regimen resulted in an IC/QALY of pound 20,432. The results were most sensitive to the quality-of-life (QOL) score for patients in remission postchemotherapy. However, even if QOL was assumed to be as poor as for patients with metastatic disease, the IC/QALY estimate rose only to pound 32,430. CONCLUSION: The use of adjuvant TAC rather than FAC for node-positive early breast cancer patients is cost effective, despite the increased drug and toxicity treatment costs, and when primary G-CSF prophylaxis is given to all patients.;J Clin Oncol. 2008 Feb 20.26(6):925-33. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2006.10.4190.;Wolowacz SE1, Cameron DA, Tate HC, Bagust A.;18281666;Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage,Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects,Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/economics*,Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use*,Axilla,Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy*,Breast Neoplasms/economics*,Breast Neoplasms/pathology,Breast Neoplasms/surgery,Chemotherapy, Adjuvant,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage,Cyclophosphamide/economics,Decision Trees,Disease-Free Survival,Doxorubicin/administration & dosage,Doxorubicin/economics,Female,Fluorouracil/administration & dosage,Fluorouracil/economics,Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/economics*,Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use*,Humans,Kaplan-Meier Estimate,Lymph Nodes/pathology*,Lymphatic Metastasis,Markov Chains,Neoplasm Staging,Neutropenia/chemically induced,Neutropenia/prevention & control*,Protective Agents/economics,Protective Agents/therapeutic use,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,Taxoids/administration & dosage,Taxoids/economics,United Kingdom,Protective Agents,Taxoids,Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor,Doxorubicin,Cyclophosphamide,Fluorouracil,CAF protocol,TAC protocol;Primary Prevention, Combined Modality Therapy, Breast Neoplasms;;model valid;0.568"not valid",Elective oophorectomy for benign gynecological disorders.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: To review the risks and benefits of elective oophorectomy and to make a clinical recommendation for an appropriate age when benefits of this procedure outweigh the risks. DESIGN: The risks and benefits of oophorectomy as detailed in published articles are reviewed with regard to quality-of-life issues and mortality outcomes in oophorectomized versus non-oophorectomized women from five diseases linked to ovarian hormones (coronary heart disease, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, stroke, and hip fracture). RESULTS: Numerous reports link oophorectomy to higher rates of cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, hip fractures, dementia, short-term memory impairment, decline in sexual function, decreased positive psychological well-being, adverse skin and body composition changes, and adverse ocular changes, as well as more severe hot flushes and urogenital atrophy. The potential benefits associated with oophorectomy include prevention of ovarian cancer, a decline in breast cancer risk, and a reduced risk of pelvic pain and subsequent ovarian surgery. In our study of long-term mortality after oophorectomy using Markov modeling, preservation of ovaries until women are at least aged 65 years was associated with higher survival rates. For women between ages 50 and 54 with hysterectomy and ovarian preservation, the probability of surviving to age 80 was 62% versus 54% if oophorectomy was performed. This 8% difference in survival is primarily due to fewer women dying from cardiovascular heart disease and/or hip fracture. This survival advantage far outweighs the 0.47% increased mortality rate from ovarian cancer prevented by oophorectomy. If surgery occurred between ages 55 and 59, the survival advantage was 4%. After age 64 there were no significant differences in survival rates. Prior literature supports our conclusion of a benefit over risk for ovarian conservation. CONCLUSIONS: Elective oophorectomy is associated with short-and long-term health consequences that merit serious consideration. For women with an average risk of ovarian cancer, ovarian conservation until at least age 65 seems to benefit long-term survival.;Menopause. 2007 May-Jun.14(3 Pt 2):580-5.;Shoupe D1, Parker WH, Broder MS, Liu Z, Farquhar C, Berek JS.;17476148;Review,Cardiovascular Diseases/etiology,Cardiovascular Diseases/mortality,Elective Surgical Procedures,Female,Humans,Neoplasms/mortality,Neoplasms/prevention & control,Ovariectomy/adverse effects*,Ovariectomy/mortality,Quality of Life,Risk Factors,Survival Rate;Primary Prevention, Combined Modality Therapy, Breast Neoplasms;;model valid;0.192"not valid",Interpreting the economic literature in oncology.;Abstract New treatment options provide hope for patients with localized and advanced cancer. However, these advances are associated with cost, both in terms of treatment-related expenditures and effects on quality of life. It is important that patients, physicians, insurers, and policymakers understand the relationship between costs and outcomes of new cancer treatments. Various methods of cost analysis can provide a structured manner to assess cost. Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) compares the cost of the intervention with the effect, resulting in a cost per effect (eg, cost per year of life gained) that can be compared across interventions. In this article, we review three recent CEAs in the oncology literature, including chemoprevention in breast cancer, adjuvant endocrine therapy in early-stage breast cancer, and salvage chemotherapy in advanced ovarian cancer. The important elements of CEA, including the recommendations of the US Public Health Service Panel on Cost Effectiveness in Health and Medicine as they relate to cancer treatments, are discussed. Many well-done CEAs in cancer treatment have been performed during the last decade. As with clinical trials, the rigor and methods of the analysis are critical to the reliability of the results. Therapies with high cost and small incremental improvement in survival and/or quality of life may find it difficult to meet the societal thresholds for what is considered cost effective. CEA is a method to assess the cost and effect of cancer treatments, providing important insights into the best use (ie, obtaining the most value for) of health care expenditures. As the literature indicates, one must be cognizant of the fact that there can be extraordinary costs associated with some newer cancer therapies that provide small incremental clinical benefit. Better understanding of the cancer economic literature can help lead to an informed dialogue on the health policy implications of resource allocation in cancer care.;J Clin Oncol. 2007 Jan 10.25(2):196-202.;Grusenmeyer PA1, Wong YN.;17210940;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Review,Antineoplastic Agents/economics,Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy*,Breast Neoplasms/economics*,Breast Neoplasms/prevention & control,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Female,Health Care Costs,Humans,Markov Chains,Medical Oncology/economics*,Medical Oncology/methods*,Medical Oncology/standards,Models, Economic*,Ovarian Neoplasms/drug therapy*,Ovarian Neoplasms/economics*,Periodicals as Topic,Salvage Therapy/economics,Salvage Therapy/methods,Antineoplastic Agents,R25CA057708/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;Primary Prevention, Combined Modality Therapy, Breast Neoplasms;;model valid;0.476"not valid",Cost-utility of adjuvant hormone therapies for breast cancer in post-menopausal women: sequential tamoxifen-exemestane and upfront anastrozole.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Adjuvant Anastrozole (ANA) for 5 years and Tamoxifen followed by Exemestane (TAM-EXE) for 2.5 years each have become acceptable alternatives to 5 years of Tamoxifen (TAM) for post-menopausal women with breast cancer. As these newer options are associated with higher drug costs as well as improved outcomes, an economic evaluation was undertaken to compare the cost-utility of ANA and TAM-EXE relative to TAM alone and to each other in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to calculate monthly costs and outcomes in a hypothetical cohort of post-menopausal women with early-stage breast cancer. Baseline rates of cancer recurrence and adverse effects with TAM, and hazard ratios associated with ANA and EXE, were derived from the ATAC and IES trials. Patients received hormonal therapy for 5 years and benefit was modeled to persist 5 years beyond treatment. The analysis took a direct payer perspective with a 20-year time horizon. Costs and outcomes were discounted by 3%. Costs are in 2005 Canadian dollars. RESULTS: ANA and TAM-EXE were associated with increased costs and QALYs, though the cost-utility of both relative to TAM alone was strongly favourable (<$50,000/QALY). Based on an indirect comparison of ANA and TAM-EXE, using TAM alone as a common comparator, the cost-utility of ANA relative to TAM-EXE appears unfavourable. CONCLUSIONS: Both upfront and sequential AI options were cost-effective alternatives to TAM alone, but TAM-EXE appears to be the economically preferred AI option based on its more favourable cost-utility versus ANA.;Breast Cancer Res Treat. 2007 Mar.101(3):325-33.

METHODS: A state-transition Markov model for a hypothetical cohort of women age 50 years was used to evaluate the effects of tamoxifen on mortality and tamoxifen price on cost-effectiveness. Incidence and mortality rates for breast and endometrial cancers were derived from Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results statistics, and noncancer outcomes were obtained from published studies. Relative risks of outcomes were derived from the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project P-1 trial. Costs were based on Medicare reimbursements. RESULTS: Projected overall mortality for women at 1.67% 5-year breast cancer risk showed little difference with or without tamoxifen, resulting in a cost-effectiveness ratio of $1,335,690 per life-year saved as a result of tamoxifen use. Adjusting for the differential impact of estrogen receptor-negative cancers, tamoxifen increased mortality for women with a uterus until the 5-year breast cancer risk reached > or =2.1%. Assigning the Canadian price for tamoxifen dramatically reduced the incremental cost (to $123,780 per life-year saved). At that price, the use of tamoxifen was less costly and more effective for women with 5-year breast cancer risks >4%. CONCLUSIONS: Tamoxifen may increase mortality in women at the lower end of the ""high-risk"" range for breast cancer. If prices in the U.S. approximated Canadian prices, then tamoxifen use for breast cancer risk reduction in women with a 5-year risk >3% could be a reasonable strategy to reduce the incidence of breast cancer. Because they are used by many unaffected individuals, the price of chemopreventive agents has a major influence on their cost-effectiveness.";Cancer. 2006 Sep 1.107(5):950-8.;Melnikow J1, Kuenneth C, Helms LJ, Barnato A, Kuppermann M, Birch S, Nuovo J.;16865680;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Anticarcinogenic Agents/economics,Anticarcinogenic Agents/therapeutic use*,Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/therapeutic use,Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy,Breast Neoplasms/economics,Breast Neoplasms/mortality*,Breast Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Canada,Cost-Benefit Analysis*,Endometrial Neoplasms/chemically induced,Female,Humans,Markov Chains*,Middle Aged,Monte Carlo Method,Neoplasms, Hormone-Dependent/economics,Risk,Tamoxifen/adverse effects,Tamoxifen/economics*,Tamoxifen/therapeutic use*,Time Factors,United States,Anticarcinogenic Agents,Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal,Tamoxifen,R01 CA86043/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;Primary Prevention, Combined Modality Therapy, Breast Neoplasms;;model valid;0.508"not valid",Cost-effectiveness of adding an electron-beam boost to tangential radiation therapy in patients with negative margins after conservative surgery for early-stage breast cancer.;Abstract PURPOSE: Electron-beam boosts (EBB) are routinely added after conservative surgery and tangential radiation therapy (TRT) for early-stage breast cancer. We performed an incremental cost-utility analysis to evaluate their cost-effectiveness. METHODS: A Markov model examined the impact of adding an EBB to TRT from a societal perspective. Outcomes were measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). On the basis of the Lyon trial, the EBB was assumed to reduce local recurrences by approximately 2% at 10 years but to have no impact on survival. Patients' utilities were used to adjust for quality of life. Given the small absolute benefit of the EBB, baseline utilities were assumed to be the same with or without it, an assumption evaluated by Monte Carlo simulation. Direct medical, time, and travel costs were considered. RESULTS: Adding the EBB led to an additional cost of $2,008, an increase of 0.0065 QALYs and, therefore, an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of over $300,000/QALY. In a sensitivity analysis, the ratio was moderately sensitive to the efficacy and cost of the EBB and highly sensitive to patients' utilities for treatment without it. Even if patients do value a small risk reduction, the mean cost-effectiveness ratio estimated by the Monte Carlo simulation remains high, at $70,859/QALY (95% confidence interval, $53,141 to $105,182/QALY). CONCLUSION: On the basis of currently available data, the cost-effectiveness ratio for the EBB is well above the commonly cited threshold for cost-effective care ($50,000/QALY). The EBB becomes cost-effective only if patients place an unexpectedly high value on the small absolute reduction in local recurrences achievable with it.;J Clin Oncol. 2000 Jan.18(2):287-95.;Hayman JA1, Hillner BE, Harris JR, Pierce LJ, Weeks JC.;10637242;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Aged,Breast Neoplasms/economics,Breast Neoplasms/radiotherapy*,Breast Neoplasms/surgery,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Electrons/therapeutic use,Female,Health Care Costs*,Humans,Lymphatic Metastasis,Markov Chains,Mastectomy, Segmental,Middle Aged,Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/economics,Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/prevention & control,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,Radiotherapy/economics*;Primary Prevention, Combined Modality Therapy, Breast Neoplasms;;model valid;0.604"not valid",Tamoxifen should be cost-effective in reducing breast cancer risk in high-risk women.;Abstract PURPOSE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of tamoxifen in the prevention of breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical trial results of National Surgical Adjuvant Breast Program P-1 compared tamoxifen versus placebo in the prevention of breast cancer, and direct medical care costs were estimated from the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research and local sources. The base estimate of effectiveness included all women on the trial. RESULTS: For every 100 women treated for 5 years, 1.665 expected cancers would not be detected. If breast cancer death is fully prevented by this strategy, then the cost-effectiveness of tamoxifen compared with no intervention is $8,479 per additional year of life gained. If lifetime prevention of the risk of death from breast cancer exceeded 17%, then the cost-effectiveness ratio would be less than $50,000 per year of life gained (a common benchmark). CONCLUSIONS: Tamoxifen for breast cancer prevention should be cost-effective under nearly all circumstances. Its use will require additional resources because it is not cost saving, but it fits within accepted guidelines.;J Clin Oncol. 2000 Jan.18(2):284-6.;Smith TJ1, Hillner BE.;10637241;Adult,Aged,Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/economics*,Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/therapeutic use,Breast Neoplasms/economics,Breast Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Cost Savings,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Female,Health Care Costs*,Humans,Middle Aged,Models, Econometric,Risk Assessment,Survival Analysis,Tamoxifen/economics*,Tamoxifen/therapeutic use,Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal,Tamoxifen;Primary Prevention, Combined Modality Therapy, Breast Neoplasms;;model valid;0.492"not valid",Pamidronate in prevention of bone complications in metastatic breast cancer: a cost-effectiveness analysis.;Abstract PURPOSE: Pamidronate is effective in reducing bony complications in patients with metastatic breast cancer who have known osteolytic lesions. However, pamidronate does not increase survival and is associated with additional financial costs and inconvenience. We conducted a post-hoc evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of pamidronate using the results of two randomized trials that evaluated pamidronate 90 mg administered intravenously every month versus placebo. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The trials differed only in the initial systemic therapy administered (hormonal or chemotherapy). Total skeletal related events (SREs), including surgery for pathologic fracture, radiation for fracture or pain control, conservatively treated pathologic fracture, spinal cord compression, or hypercalcemia, were taken directly from the trials. Using a societal perspective, direct health care costs were assigned to each SRE. Each group's monthly survival was equal and was projected to decline using observed median survivals. The cost of pamidronate reflected the average wholesale price of the drug plus infusion. The value or disutility of an adverse event per month was evaluated using a zero value (events avoided) or an assigned one (range, 0.2 to 0.8). RESULTS: The cost of pamidronate therapy exceeded the cost savings from prevented adverse events. The difference between the treated and placebo groups was larger with hormonal systemic therapy than with chemotherapy (additional $7,685 compared with $3,968 per woman). The projected net cost per SRE avoided was $3,940 with chemotherapy and $9,390 with hormonal therapy. The cost-effectiveness ratios were $108,200 with chemotherapy and $305, 300 with hormonal therapy per quality-adjusted year. CONCLUSION: Although pamidronate is effective in preventing a feared, common adverse outcome in metastatic breast cancer, its use is associated with high incremental costs per adverse event avoided. The analysis is most sensitive to the costs of pamidronate and pathologic fractures that were asymptomatic or treated conservatively.;J Clin Oncol. 2000 Jan.18(1):72-9.;Hillner BE1, Weeks JC, Desch CE, Smith TJ.;10623695;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Antineoplastic Agents/economics*,Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use,Bone Neoplasms/prevention & control,Bone Neoplasms/secondary*,Bone Neoplasms/therapy,Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy*,Breast Neoplasms/economics,Breast Neoplasms/pathology,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Diphosphonates/economics*,Diphosphonates/therapeutic use,Disease-Free Survival,Female,Health Care Costs*,Humans,Middle Aged,Models, Econometric,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,Virginia,Antineoplastic Agents,Diphosphonates,pamidronate;Primary Prevention, Combined Modality Therapy, Breast Neoplasms;;model valid;0.612"not valid",A risk-benefit analysis of elective bilateral oophorectomy: effect of changes in compliance with estrogen therapy on outcome.;Abstract A bilateral oophorectomy at the time of elective hysterectomy is often performed to prevent ovarian cancer. The assumption that endogenous estrogen can be easily replaced with supplemental medication fosters the decision for routine oophorectomy. Published reports on the use of postmenopausal estrogen indicate that compliance is less than perfect. This fact could affect the overall outcome. Decision analysis techniques with Markov cohort modeling were used to evaluate the policy of elective bilateral oophorectomy. Results from studies judged methodologically sound were combined to determine values representing the influence of estrogen on coronary heart disease, breast cancer, and osteoporotic fracture. The decision tree also explicitly incorporated patient compliance. When compliance with estrogen therapy is assumed to be perfect, oophorectomy yields longer life expectancy than retaining the ovaries. When actual drug-taking behavior is considered, retaining the ovaries results in longer survival. This analysis highlights the importance of including the effects of patient compliance with treatment recommendations when the impact of a health policy decision such as prophylactic surgery is assessed.;Am J Obstet Gynecol. 1991 Jan.164(1 Pt 1):165-74.;Speroff T1, Dawson NV, Speroff L, Haber RJ.;1986605;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Breast Neoplasms/prevention & control,Coronary Disease/etiology,Decision Support Techniques,Estrogens/therapeutic use*,Female,Hip Fractures/etiology,Humans,Mortality,Ovariectomy/adverse effects*,Patient Compliance*,Risk Factors,Estrogens;Primary Prevention, Combined Modality Therapy, Breast Neoplasms;;model valid;0.22"not valid",Cost-effectiveness of prophylactic cranial irradiation with hippocampal avoidance in limited stage small cell lung cancer.;Abstract BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in limited stage small cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC) prevents brain metastases and improves survival, with the potential for neurocognitive toxicity. RTOG0933 demonstrated that hippocampal avoidance (HA) during whole brain radiotherapy preserves neurocognition. This study's objective was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of HA-PCI in LS-SCLC through decision analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov model was developed to simulate the clinical course of LS-SCLC who received HA-PCI or conventional PCI (C-PCI). A willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY was used. Incremental cost effectiveness ratio was calculated (ICER). Sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the parameter thresholds and to assess the robustness of the model. RESULTS: In the base case scenario, HA-PCI is more cost-effective than C-PCI, with an ICER of $47,107/QALY. HA-PCI was preferred over C-PCI provided that the risk of developing brain metastases was not increased by at least 14%, or if neurocognitive dysfunction rates were reduced by at least 40%. HA-PCI was the cost-effective strategy in 68% of tested iterations in probabilistic sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that HA-PCI is more cost-effective than C-PCI in LS-SCLC. Our results support the use of HA-PCI in this patient population, should results from RTOG0933 be confirmed by the ongoing NRGCC003 trial. Copyright � 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, there are few data on the economic impact of pegfilgrastim use, especially in the context of small-cell lung cancer. METHODS: This retrospective study involved 31 patients and 129 treatment cycles (32 with pegfilgrastim and 97 with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)). We estimated the direct costs for preventing and managing febrile aplasia from the payer's perspective and also conducted a willingness-to-pay study with 100 healthy subjects, in order to estimate how highly a single-jab strategy was valued relative to multiple injections. RESULTS: The costs per cycle were respectively 1743 euros+/- 837 euros and 1466 euros +/- 836 euros for the pegfilgrastim and G-CSF strategies (p < 0.001). The excess cost of the pegfilgrastim strategy was partly compensated for by the perceived value of the single-jab strategy: 88% of interviewees would prefer the pegfilgrastim strategy. 16% would be willing to pay all the excess cost (277 euros) and 67% would be willing to pay half the excess cost. CONCLUSION: In this willingness-to-pay survey, the excess cost associated with pegfilgrastim relative to other G-CSF-based prophylactic strategies is partly offset by the perceived convenience of a single injection.;Curr Med Res Opin. 2009 Jun.25(6):1455-60. doi: 10.1185/03007990902918156.;Tan Sean P1, Chouaid C, Hettler D, Baud M, Hejblum G, Tilleul P.;19419340;Evaluation Studies,Multicenter Study,Adult,Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects,Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use*,Cost of Illness,Female,Filgrastim,Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/economics*,Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use*,Health Care Costs,Humans,Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy*,Lung Neoplasms/economics,Male,Middle Aged,Models, Economic,Neutropenia/chemically induced,Neutropenia/economics,Neutropenia/prevention & control*,Patient Acceptance of Health Care,Polyethylene Glycols,Recombinant Proteins,Retrospective Studies,Small Cell Lung Carcinoma/drug therapy*,Small Cell Lung Carcinoma/economics,Socioeconomic Factors,Recombinant Proteins,Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor,Polyethylene Glycols,pegfilgrastim,Filgrastim;Primary Prevention, Combined Modality Therapy, Lung Neoplasms;;model valid;0.284"not valid",Cost-effectiveness of combination thromboembolism prophylaxis in gynecologic oncology surgery.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost-effectiveness of external pneumatic compression devices with and without the addition of low-molecular-weight heparin for the prevention of deep vein thrombosis in high-risk surgical patients with gynecologic cancer. METHODS: A Markov decision analytic model was used to estimate the costs and outcomes associated with the prophylactic use of external pneumatic compression with and without low-molecular-weight heparin in patients undergoing gynecologic surgery. We estimated cost per fatal pulmonary embolus prevented, cost per deep vein thrombus prevented, and cost per life-year saved. Probability estimates for various outcomes and efficacies were obtained from the literature, using data specific for gynecologic surgery patients when available. RESULTS: In the base case scenario, cost-effectiveness estimates for combination prophylaxis varied from 10,091 dollars per life-year saved for a 35-year-old patient with IB cervix cancer patient to 50,181 dollars for a 65-year-old patient with stage IIIC ovarian cancer, costs within the 50,000-65,000 dollars per life-year saved threshold considered to be cost-effective. Combination prophylaxis appeared to be cost-effective in gynecologic oncology patients as long as the risk of perioperative thromboembolism using this method of prevention was less than or equal to 4%. Sensitivity analysis indicated that variation of the marginal cost of low-molecular-weight heparin and the marginal effectiveness to extremes did not change the conclusions of the statistical model. CONCLUSION: The use of combination therapy external pneumatic compression is estimated to be cost-effective for high-risk gynecologic oncology patients undergoing surgery.

METHODS: A model was constructed to estimate the costs and outcomes associated with the use of external pneumatic compression, unfractionated heparin, and low molecular weight heparin in women with cervical, endometrial, and ovarian cancer. We estimated cost per DVT prevented, per fatal pulmonary embolus (PE) prevented, and per life-year saved. Probability estimates for various outcomes and efficacies were obtained from the literature, using data specific for gynecologic patients when available. RESULTS: Cost-effectiveness estimates ranged from $27 per life-year saved for a 55-year-old endometrial cancer patient to $5132 per life-year saved for a 65-year-old with ovarian cancer. Although low molecular weight heparin and unfractionated heparin were cost-effective compared with no prophylaxis, each was less effective than external pneumatic compression in the base case. The results of the analysis were sensitive to assumptions about the relative risk of DVT, the life expectancy of the patient, the costs of future treatment, and the relative effectiveness of the different strategies: If unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin is at least 2-3% more effective than external pneumatic compression, then the incremental cost per life-year of either would be less than $50,000 compared with external pneumatic compression. CONCLUSION: Prophylaxis of DVT is cost-effective in terms of life-years gained even for patients with relatively short life expectancies, such as ovarian cancer patients. External pneumatic compression appears to be the most cost-effective strategy under our baseline assumptions, but further studies in gynecologic cancer are needed to validate our conclusions.;Obstet Gynecol. 2000 Feb.95(2):206-14.;Maxwell GL1, Myers ER, Clarke-Pearson DL.;10674581;Adult,Aged,Anticoagulants/economics,Anticoagulants/therapeutic use,Bandages/economics,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Decision Support Techniques,Endometrial Neoplasms/surgery,Female,Genital Neoplasms, Female/surgery*,Gynecologic Surgical Procedures*/adverse effects,Gynecologic Surgical Procedures*/economics,Heparin/economics,Heparin/therapeutic use,Humans,Middle Aged,Models, Economic,Ovarian Neoplasms/surgery,United States,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/surgery,Venous Thrombosis/economics*,Venous Thrombosis/prevention & control*,Anticoagulants,Heparin;Primary Prevention,Combined Modality Therapy,Lung Neoplasms,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.576"not valid",Adjuvant HPV vaccination for anal cancer prevention in HIV-positive men who have sex with men: The time is now.;"Abstract IMPORTANCE: Outcomes of treating high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL), a precursor to anal cancer, remain uncertain. Emerging evidence shows that post HSIL treatment adjuvant quadrivalent human papillomavirus (qHPV) vaccination improves the effectiveness of treatment. However, no recommendations exist regarding the use of qHPV vaccine as an adjuvant form of therapy. Our objective was to determine whether post-treatment adjuvant vaccination should be adopted in HIV-infected MSM (individuals at highest risk for anal cancer) on the basis of cost-effectiveness determined using existing evidence or whether future research is needed. METHODS: We developed a Markov (state-transition) cohort model to assess the cost-effectiveness of post-treatment adjuvant HPV vaccination of 27years or older HIV-infected MSM. We first estimated cost-effectiveness and then performed value-of-information (VOI) analysis to determine whether future research is required by estimating the expected value of perfect information (EVPI). We also estimated expected value of partial perfect information (EVPPI) to determine what new evidences should have highest priority. RESULTS: With the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $71,937/QALY, ""treatment plus vaccination"" was the most cost-effective HSIL management strategy using the willingness-to-pay threshold of 100,000/QALY. We found that population-level EVPI for conducting future clinical research evaluating HSIL management approaches was US$12 million (range $6-$20 million). The EVPPI associated with adjuvant qHPV vaccination efficacy estimated in terms of hazards of decreasing HSIL recurrence was $0 implying that additional data from a future study evaluating efficacy of adjuvant qHPV vaccination will not change our policy conclusion that ""treatment plus vaccination"" was cost-effective. Both the ICER and EVPI were sensitive to HSIL treatment compliance. CONCLUSION: Post-treatment adjuvant qHPV vaccination in HIV-infected MSM aged 27 or above is likely to be cost-effective. Use of adjuvant qHPV vaccination could be considered as a potential strategy to reduce rising anal cancer burden among these high-risk individuals. Copyright � 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, evidence regarding cost-effectiveness is sought by policy makers when making this decision. The current study was undertaken to evaluate the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained with introduction of the HPV vaccine compared with a no-vaccination scenario. METHODS: A static progression model, using a combination of decision tree and Markov models, was populated using epidemiological, cost, coverage, and effectiveness data to determine the cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination. Using a societal perspective, lifetime costs and consequences (in terms of QALYs) among a cohort of 11-year-old adolescent girls in Punjab state were modeled in 2 alternate scenarios with and without vaccination. All costs and consequences were discounted at a rate of 3%. RESULTS: Although immunizing 1 year's cohort of 11-year-old girls in Punjab state costs Indian National Rupees (INR) 135 million (US dollars [USD] 2.08 million and International dollars [Int$] 6.25 million) on an absolute basis, its net cost after accounting for treatment savings is INR 38 million (USD 0.58 million and Int$ 1.76 million). Incremental cost per QALY gained for HPV vaccination was found to be INR 73 (USD 1.12 and Int$ 3.38). Given all the data uncertainties, there is a 90% probability for the vaccination strategy to be cost-effective in Punjab state at a willingness-to-pay threshold of INR 10,000, which is less than one-tenth of the per capita gross domestic product. CONCLUSIONS: HPV vaccination appears to be a very cost-effective strategy for Punjab state, and is likely to be cost-effective for other Indian states.

Cost is represented by insurer and patient payments for care. METHODS: We estimated the mean medical care costs during the first 2years after the index diagnosis date for patients with cervical cancer (cases). Cases were identified using claims-based International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9), diagnosis codes and matched to controls without a claims-based ICD-9 code for cancer using a 2-step propensity score matching method. Index dates for the cases were randomly assigned to potential controls, and cases and controls were matched by index date. Data for cancer cases and controls were obtained from the de-identified 2011-2014 U.S. MarketScan databases. A generalized linear model was employed to compute the cost for censored months during the 2-year follow-up period. Differential costs were assessed by subtracting the medical costs incurred by controls from those incurred by cases. RESULTS: During 2011-2014, 475 commercially insured Texas patients with newly diagnosed cervical cancer met the inclusion criteria. The first-year and second-year mean medical costs were $60,828 and $37,721 for cases and $9982 and $10,066 for controls, respectively. The differential costs of cervical cancer for the first and second years were $50,846 and $27,656, respectively. The major correlates of higher monthly cervical cancer costs were higher Charlson Comorbidity Index score during 6months period prior to diagnosis, higher healthcare costs between 6months and 3months prior to diagnosis, and residence in the western region of Texas. Costs for cervical cancer patients decreased steeply between month 1 and month 5 after diagnosis and then were stable, while costs for the control group were stable throughout the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: Mean direct medical costs associated with cervical cancer in Texas were substantial. These data will serve as key cost parameters in models of costs associated with human papillomavirus (HPV)-related cancers in Texas and the economic evaluation of HPV vaccination dissemination in Texas.

DESIGN: Bayesian evidence synthesis approach used to evaluate the impact of vaccination against HPV types 16 and 18 on the burden of anal, penile, and oropharyngeal carcinomas among heterosexual men and men who have sex with men. The reduced transmission of vaccine-type HPV from vaccination of girls was assumed to lower the risk of HPV associated cancer in all men but not to affect the excess risk of HPV associated cancers among men who have sex with men. SETTING: General population in the Netherlands. INTERVENTION: Inclusion of boys aged 12 into HPV vaccination programmes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and numbers needed to vaccinate. RESULTS: Before HPV vaccination, 14.9 (95% credible interval 12.2 to 18.1) QALYs per thousand men were lost to vaccine preventable cancers associated with HPV in the Netherlands. This burden would be reduced by 37% (28% to 48%) if the vaccine uptake among girls remains at the current level of 60%. To prevent one additional case of cancer among men, 795 boys (660 to 987) would need to be vaccinated. with tumour specific numbers for anal, penile, and oropharyngeal cancer of 2162, 3486, and 1975, respectively. The burden of HPV related cancer in men would be reduced by 66% (53% to 805) if vaccine uptake among girls increases to 90%. In that case, 1735 boys (1240 to 2900) would need to be vaccinated to prevent an additional case. with tumour specific numbers for anal, penile, and oropharyngeal cancer of 2593, 29107, and 6484, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Men will benefit indirectly from vaccination of girls but remain at risk of cancers associated with HPV. The incremental benefit of vaccinating boys when vaccine uptake among girls is high is driven by the prevention of anal carcinomas, which underscores the relevance of HPV prevention efforts for men who have sex with men. � Bogaards et al 2015.;BMJ. 2015 May 12.350:h2016. doi: 10.1136/bmj.h2016.;Bogaards JA1, Wallinga J2, Brakenhoff RH3, Meijer CJ4, Berkhof J5.;25985328;Evaluation Studies,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adolescent,Adult,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Anus Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Anus Neoplasms/virology,Bayes Theorem,Child,Cost of Illness,Female,Heterosexuality,Homosexuality, Male,Humans,Male,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical,Netherlands,Oropharyngeal Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Oropharyngeal Neoplasms/virology,Papillomavirus Infections/complications,Papillomavirus Infections/prevention & control*,Papillomavirus Vaccines*,Penile Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Penile Neoplasms/virology,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,Registries,Vaccination/standards,Papillomavirus Vaccines;Primary Prevention, Combined Modality Therapy, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;model valid;0.416"not valid",Prevention of adhesion formation after radical hysterectomy using a sodium hyaluronate-carboxymethylcellulose (HA-CMC) barrier: a cost-effectiveness analysis.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of an adhesion prevention strategy compared to routine care, in which no adhesion prevention measures are taken, through a decision analysis model in the clinical setting of patients undergoing radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy for Stage IB cervical cancer. METHODS: A decision analysis model compared two strategies to manage the risk of adhesion-related morbidity following radical hysterectomy for Stage IB cervical cancer: (1) routine care with no adhesion prevention measures, and (2) the intervention strategy with a HA-CMC anti-adhesion barrier. The cost-effectiveness of each strategy was evaluated from the perspective of society and that of a third party payer. RESULTS: From the perspective of society, the HA-CMC strategy had an overall cost per patient of $1932 and effectiveness of 7.901 QALYs and dominated the routine care strategy, which had a cost per patient of $3043 and effectiveness of 7.805 QALYs. From the perspective of a third party payer, the HA-CMC strategy had an overall cost per patient of $1247 and effectiveness of 7.987 QALYs and dominated the routine care strategy, which had a cost per patient of $1629 and effectiveness of 7.970 QALYs. A series of one-way sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the model. CONCLUSIONS: Under a conservative set of clinical and economic assumptions, an adhesion prevention strategy utilizing a HA-CMC barrier in patients undergoing radical hysterectomy for Stage IB cervical cancer is cost-effective from both the perspective of society as a whole and that of a third party payer.;Gynecol Oncol. 2007 Mar.104(3):739-46.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decision-analytic Markov model was constructed to examine the effect of late rectal toxicity and compare the costs and quality-adjusted Life Years (QALYs) of IMRT-O and IMRT+S. The main assumption of this modeling study was that disease progression, genito-urinary toxicity and survival were equal for both comparators. RESULTS: For all patients, IMRT+S revealed a lower toxicity than IMRT-O. Treatment follow-up and toxicity costs for IMRT-O and IMRT+S amounted to �1604 and �1444, respectively, thus saving �160 on the complication costs at an extra charge of �1700 for the spacer in IMRT+S. The QALYs yielded for IMRT-O and IMRT+S were 3.542 and 3.570, respectively. This results in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of �55,880 per QALY gained. For a ceiling ratio of �80,000, IMRT+S had a 77% probability of being cost-effective. CONCLUSION: IMRT+S is cost-effective compared to IMRT-O based on its potential to reduce radiotherapy-related toxicity. Copyright � 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd..

We sought to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of aspirin as an adjuvant therapy in Stage I and II colorectal cancer patients aged 65 years and older. METHODS: Two five-state Markov models were constructed separately for Stage I and II colorectal cancer using TreeAge Pro 2014. Two hypothetical cohorts of 10,000 individuals at a starting age of 65 years and with colorectal cancer in remission were put through the models separately. Cost-effectiveness of aspirin was evaluated against no treatment (Stage I and II) and capecitabine (Stage II) over a 20-year period from the United States societal perspective. Extensive one-way sensitivity analyses and multivariable Probabilistic Sensitivity Analyses (PSA) were performed. RESULTS: In the base case analyses, aspirin was cheaper and more effective compared to other comparators in both stages. Sensitivity analyses showed that no treatment and capecitabine (Stage II only) can be cost-effective alternatives if the utility of taking aspirin is below 0.909, aspirin's annual fatal adverse event probability exceeds 0.57%, aspirin's relative risk of disease progression is 0.997 or more, or when capecitabine's relative risk of disease progression is less than 0.228. Probabilistic Sensitivity Analyses (PSA) further showed that aspirin could be cost-effective 50% to 80% of the time when the willingness-to-pay threshold was varied from USD 20,000 to USD 100,000. CONCLUSION: Even with a modest treatment benefit, aspirin is likely to be cost-effective in Stage I and II colorectal cancer, thus suggesting a potential unique role in secondary prevention in this group of patients.;PLoS One. 2014 Sep 24.9(9):e107866. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0107866. eCollection 2014.;Soon SS1, Chia WK2, Chan ML1, Ho GF3, Jian X4, Deng YH4, Tan CS5, Sharma A6, Segelov E7, Mehta S8, Ali R9, Toh HC2, Wee HL1.;25250815;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Aged,Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/economics,Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/therapeutic use,Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/economics,Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use,Aspirin/economics*,Aspirin/therapeutic use*,Capecitabine,Chemotherapy, Adjuvant/methods,Colorectal Neoplasms/drug therapy*,Colorectal Neoplasms/pathology,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Deoxycytidine/analogs & derivatives,Deoxycytidine/economics,Deoxycytidine/therapeutic use,Fluorouracil/analogs & derivatives,Fluorouracil/economics,Fluorouracil/therapeutic use,Humans,Markov Chains*,Models, Economic,Neoplasm Recurrence, Local,Neoplasm Staging,Outcome Assessment (Health Care)/economics,Outcome Assessment (Health Care)/statistics & numerical data,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,Remission Induction,Reproducibility of Results,Secondary Prevention/methods,Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal,Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic,Deoxycytidine,Capecitabine,Aspirin,Fluorouracil;Primary Prevention, Combined Modality Therapy, Prostatic Neoplasms;;model valid;0.472"not valid",Cost-effectiveness of prophylaxis treatment strategies for febrile neutropenia in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of primary prophylaxis (PP) or secondary prophylaxis (SP) with pegfilgrastim, filgrastim (6-day and 11-day), or no prophylaxis to reduce the risk of febrile neutropenia (FN) in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer receiving docetaxel or topotecan. METHODS: A Markov model was used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of PP vs SP from a US payer perspective. Model inputs, including the efficacy of each strategy (relative risk of FN with prophylaxis compared to no prophylaxis) and mortality, costs, and utility values were estimated from public sources and peer-reviewed publications. Incremental cost-effectiveness was evaluated in terms of net cost per FN event avoided, incremental cost per life-year saved (LYS), and incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained over a lifetime horizon. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (DSA and PSA) were conducted. RESULTS: For patients receiving docetaxel, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for PP vs SP with pegfilgrastim was $7900 per QALY gained, and PP with pegfilgrastim dominated all other comparators. For patients receiving topotecan, PP with pegfilgrastim dominated all comparators. Model results were most sensitive to baseline FN risk. PP vs SP with pegfilgrastim was cost effective in 68% and 83% of simulations for docetaxel and in >99% of simulations for topotecan at willingness-to-pay thresholds of $50,000 and $100,000 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: PP with pegfilgrastim should be considered cost effective compared to other prophylaxis strategies in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer receiving docetaxel or topotecan with a high risk of FN.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of measuring bone mineral density (BMD) before initiating ADT followed by alendronate therapy in men with localized prostate cancer. DESIGN: Markov state-transition model simulating the progression of prostate cancer and the incidence of hip fracture. DATA SOURCES: Published literature. TARGET POPULATION: A hypothetical cohort of men aged 70 years with locally advanced or high-risk localized prostate cancer starting a 2-year course of ADT after radiation therapy. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTION: No BMD test or alendronate therapy, a BMD test followed by selective alendronate therapy for patients with osteoporosis, or universal alendronate therapy without a BMD test. OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), measured by cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: The ICERs for the strategy of a BMD test and selective alendronate therapy for patients with osteoporosis and universal alendronate therapy without a BMD test were $66,800 per QALY gained and $178,700 per QALY gained, respectively. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSES: The ICER for universal alendronate therapy without a BMD test decreased to $100,000 per QALY gained, assuming older age, a history of fractures, lower mean BMD before ADT, or a lower cost of alendronate. LIMITATIONS: No evidence shows that alendronate reduces actual fracture rates in patients with prostate cancer who receive ADT. The model predicted fracture rates by using data on the surrogate BMD end point. CONCLUSION: In patients starting adjuvant ADT for locally advanced or high-risk localized prostate cancer, a BMD test followed by selective alendronate for those with osteoporosis is a cost-effective use of resources. Routine use of alendronate without a BMD test is justifiable in patients at higher risk for hip fractures.;Ann Intern Med. 2010 May 18.152(10):621-9. doi: 10.7326/0003-4819-152-10-201005180-00002.;Ito K1, Elkin EB, Girotra M, Morris MJ.;20479027;Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Alendronate/adverse effects,Alendronate/therapeutic use*,Androgen Antagonists/adverse effects*,Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects*,Bone Density,Bone Density Conservation Agents/adverse effects,Bone Density Conservation Agents/therapeutic use*,Combined Modality Therapy,Computer Simulation,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Disease Progression,Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone/agonists,Hip Fractures/prevention & control*,Humans,Male,Markov Chains,Middle Aged,Orchiectomy/adverse effects*,Osteoporosis/complications,Prostatic Neoplasms/physiopathology,Prostatic Neoplasms/therapy*,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,Risk Factors,Androgen Antagonists,Antineoplastic Agents,Bone Density Conservation Agents,Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone,Alendronate,P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;Primary Prevention, Combined Modality Therapy, Prostatic Neoplasms;;model valid;0.624"not valid",Antidepressants, Depression, and Venous Thromboembolism Risk: Large Prospective Study of UK Women.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Some investigators have reported an excess risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) associated with depression and with use of antidepressant drugs. We explored these associations in a large prospective study of UK women. METHODS AND RESULTS: The Million Women Study recruited 1.3 million women through the National Health Service Breast Screening Programme in England and Scotland. Three years after recruitment, women were sent a second questionnaire that enquired about depression and regular use of medications in the previous 4 weeks. The present analysis included those who responded and did not have prior VTE, cancer, or recent surgery. Follow-up for VTE was through linkage to routinely collected National Health Service statistics. Cox regression analyses yielded adjusted hazard ratios and 95% CIs. A total of 734 092 women (mean age 59.9 years) were included in the analysis. 6.9% reported use of antidepressants, 2.7% reported use of other psychotropic drugs, and 1.8% reported being treated for depression or anxiety but not use of psychotropic drugs. During follow-up for an average of 7.3 years, 3922 women were hospitalized for and/or died from VTE. Women who reported antidepressant use had a significantly higher risk of VTE than women who reported neither depression nor use of psychotropic drugs (hazard ratio, 1.39. 95% CI, 1.23-1.56). VTE risk was not significantly increased in women who reported being treated for depression or anxiety but no use of antidepressants or other psychotropic drugs (hazard ratio, 1.19. 95% CI, 0.95-1.49). CONCLUSIONS: Use of antidepressants is common in UK women and is associated with an increased risk of VTE. � 2017 The Authors.

Whether advances in systemic therapies have rendered previously observed benefits of screening less significant is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To compare the outcomes of breast cancer screening trials had they been conducted using contemporary systemic treatments with outcomes of trials conducted with previously used treatments. DESIGN: Computer simulation model of 3 virtual screening trials with similar reductions in advanced-stage cancer cases but reflecting treatment patterns in 1975 (prechemotherapy era), 1999, or 2015 (treatment according to receptor status). DATA SOURCES: Meta-analyses of screening and treatment trials. study of dissemination of primary systemic treatments. SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) registry. TARGET POPULATION: U.S. women aged 50 to 74 years. TIME HORIZON: 10 and 25 years. PERSPECTIVE: Population. INTERVENTION: Mammography, chemotherapy, tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors, and trastuzumab. OUTCOME MEASURES: Breast cancer mortality rate ratio (MRR) and absolute risk reduction (ARR) obtained by the difference in cumulative breast cancer mortality between control and screening groups. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: At 10 years, screening in a 1975 trial yielded an MRR of 90% and an ARR of 5 deaths per 10,000 women. A 2015 screening trial yielded a 10-year MRR of 90% and an ARR of 3 deaths per 10,000 women. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Greater reductions in advanced-stage disease yielded a greater screening effect, but MRRs remained similar across trials. However, ARRs were consistently lower under contemporary treatments. When contemporary treatments were available only for early-stage cases, the MRR was 88%. LIMITATION: Disease models simplify reality and cannot capture all breast cancer subtypes. CONCLUSION: Advances in systemic therapies for breast cancer have not substantively reduced the relative benefits of screening but have likely reduced the absolute benefits because of their positive effect on breast cancer survival.

However, HBV can reactivate with immunosuppression. chemotherapy causes reactivation in 22 % of hepatitis B surface antigen-positive patients. HBV reactivation can be fatal. HBV reactivation can be prevented, provided that HBV is recognized prior to chemotherapy. The objective of this study is to estimate the health and economic effects of HBV screening strategies in patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer. We developed a state-transition microsimulation model to examine the cost-effectiveness of three HBV screening strategies: (1) ""No screening"". (2) ""Screen-and-Treat to prevent reactivation"" (screen-all) with either lamivudine/tenofovir (LAM/TDF) or entecavir (ETV). and (3) ""Screen-and-Treat high-risk only"" (screen-HR) and treat with either LAM/TDF or ETV. Model data were obtained from the published literature. We used a payer's perspective, a lifetime horizon, and a 5 % discount rate for the analysis. ""Screen-all"" would prevent at least 38 severe reactivations per 100,000 persons screened over the lifetime of the cohort. ""Screen-all"" was associated with an increase of 0.0034-0.0035 QALYs and an additional cost of C$164-C$266 per person, which translated into an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of C$47,808/QALY-C$76,527/QALY gained compared with ""No screening"" depending on the antiviral therapy received. ""Screen-all"" was the most cost-effective strategy, while ""Screen-HR"" was inferior in all scenarios tested.

The additional effect of mammography screening remains uncertain, in particular for women aged 40-49 years. We therefore assessed the effects of screening starting between age 40 and 50, as compared to the effects of adjuvant systemic therapy. The use of adjuvant endocrine therapy, chemotherapy and the combination of endocrine- and chemotherapy, as well as the uptake of mammography screening in the Netherlands was modeled using micro-simulation. The effects of screening and treatment were modeled based on randomized controlled trials. The effects of adjuvant therapy, biennial screening between age 50 and 74 in the presence of adjuvant therapy, and extending the screening programme by starting at age 40 were assessed by comparing breast cancer mortality in women aged 0-100 years in scenarios with and without these interventions. In 2008, adjuvant treatment was estimated to have reduced the breast cancer mortality rate in the simulated population by 13.9%, compared to a situation without treatment. Biennial screening between age 50 and 74 further reduced the mortality rate by 15.7%. Extending screening to age 48 would lower the mortality rate by 1.0% compared to screening from age 50. 10 additional screening rounds between age 40 and 49 would reduce this rate by 5.1%. Adjuvant systemic therapy and screening reduced breast cancer mortality in similar amounts. Expanding the lower age limit of screening would further reduce breast cancer mortality.;Int J Cancer. 2015 Jul 1.137(1):165-72. doi: 10.1002/ijc.29364.

After this, for patients aged over 60 years who have undergone mastectomy, there is a shift of care to the National Screening Programme (NSP) for mammography every 2 years. After breast-conserving therapy follow-up is perfomed by the general practitioner (GP), with mammography every second year and physical examination annually. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical effects and costs of four different strategies for follow-up after breast cancer treatment. METHODS: An extended and validated simulation model for breast cancer follow-up was used. The current guidelines for follow-up (baseline strategy) and three less intensive follow-up strategies were evaluated. The main outcome measure was the detection rate of small tumours (2 cm or smaller) and associated costs for each strategy. RESULTS: Shortening the follow-up time in hospital by shifting care to the NSP or GP after 2 years instead of 5 years of hospital follow-up, lowering the age of referral to the NSP or GP from 60 to 50 years, and termination of annual physical examination by the GP after hospital follow-up did not decrease the detection of small tumours. In addition, a substantial decrease in costs was observed with simplified follow-up. CONCLUSION: Decreasing hospital follow-up time, lowering the age of referral to the NSP or GP, and termination of annual physical examinations would lead to a substantial reduction in costs while maintaining the possibility of detecting small breast cancers.

We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of HBV screening before chemotherapy given for nonhematopoietic solid tumors (STs). METHODS: A decision-analytic model was used to compare the cost-effectiveness of universal screening conducted per professional guidelines versus no screening in hypothetical patient cohorts beginning adjuvant chemotherapy for early breast cancer or palliative chemotherapy for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. Survival times were extrapolated using Markov models. Probabilities were derived from published studies and costs estimated from the perspective of the Australian health care system. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed, including with the application of an alternative HBV screening strategy. RESULTS: Using an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio threshold of $50,000 (Australian dollars) per life-year (LY) saved, universal HBV screening was not cost-effective for adjuvant patients ($88,224/LY, 13% probability of being cost-effective), palliative patients ($1,344,251/LY, 0%), or pooled (all) patients ($149,857/LY, 1%). Sensitivity analyses found that screening approached cost-effectiveness among adjuvant patients with the highest reported rates of undiagnosed chronic HBV (65%, $59,445/LY) or HBV reactivation with chemotherapy (41%, $56,537/LY). Cost- effectiveness was also significantly influenced by HBV population prevalence. An alternative screening strategy using hepatitis B surface antigen testing only produced the most economically favorable results, with $30,126/LY (80% probability) for adjuvant patients and $51,201/LY (43%) for the pooled cohort. CONCLUSION: Universal HBV screening conducted per current guidelines is not cost-effective in patients with STs. Screening may be economically favorable in selected patient subpopulations and/or with simplification of the screening strategy.;J Clin Oncol. 2011 Aug 20.29(24):3270-7. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2011.35.1635.

Theoretical models in oncology and their implications in surgical therapy].;"Abstract Cancer biology has proven to be far more complex than imagined twenty years ago. While current treatment strategies (i.e., surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation) are successful in many cancers, they all have limitations. In some types of solid tumors some survival progress has been recorded, such in the case of breast and colorectal cancer, but these improvements are probably mainly due to screening programmes and earlier detection than to more-effective treatment. In other tumor types the mortality certainly increased: the death rate from lung cancer rose from 43 to 53 per 100,000 people from 1975 to 2005, the death rate from melanoma has risen nearly 30 percent, and death rate from liver and bile-duct cancer almost doubled, from 2.8 to 5.3 per 100,000. Cancer is commonly viewed as minimally controlled by modern medicine, especially when compared with other major diseases (Sharon Begley, 2008). Either directly from the phenomenological observation or through the biological model, mathematicians and biologists can generate mathematical models aimed at describing the biological phenomenon. The analysis of the solution properties by mathematical methods will give a description of the dynamics resulting in a deeper insight into the problem. The models can be implemented numerically to give rise to in silico models. The quality of the modeling process can be tested, validating the results of the simulations with experiments and clinical data. The theoretical predictions generated from the models may optimize the experimental protocol by identifying the most promising candidates for further clinical investigation. The speed with which large numbers of simulations can be performed may reduce the number of animal experiments and identify new experimental programmes and optimal cancer therapy schedules. However, it is clear that surgical decisions in cancer therapy are strongly driven by the theoretical hypotheses of local tumor evolution and malignant cells dissemination. For 60 years cancer was seen as a disease that arose in one location and spread through the lymphatic system first to nearby lymph nodes and subsequently to other organs. This theory of ""contiguous"" development of metastases has become known as the Virchow-Halsted theory. After 1954 an alternative theory was formulated by B. Fisher stating ""that breast cancer is a systemic disease"". Following the therapeutic implications of this ""systemic theory,"" the disease has been attacked in recent years by chemotherapy and hormone therapy to the whole body. In 1994 S. Hellman stated the case for what he calls the ""spectrum theory."" He observed that there are intermediate tumor states between purely localized lesions and widely metastatic. Such clinical circumstances are not accounted for by either the contiguous (Halsted theory) or the systemic (systemic theory) hypotheses and supports the idea that loco-regional therapies (surgery and radiotherapy) may be useful in some cases. So, it is obvious that the extent and the role of cancer surgery are direct consequences of our theoretical understanding of cancer natural history. The genetical, pathological and clinical heterogeneity of cancers suggest new theoretical approaches based on chaos and fractal theory.";Chirurgia (Bucur). 2011 Jan-Feb.106(1):17-22.;Vasilescu C1.;21523955;English Abstract,Review,Computer Simulation/trends,Early Detection of Cancer,Humans,Mass Screening,Medical Oncology/trends*,Models, Biological,Models, Theoretical*,Neoplasm Invasiveness,Neoplasms/diagnosis,Neoplasms/mortality,Neoplasms/surgery*,Neoplasms/therapy,Surgical Procedures, Operative/trends,Survival Analysis;Breast Neoplasms,Combined Modality Therapy,Lung Neoplasms,Early Detection of Cancer;;model valid;0.364"not valid",Race-specific impact of natural history, mammography screening, and adjuvant treatment on breast cancer mortality rates in the United States.;Abstract BACKGROUND: U.S. Black women have higher breast cancer mortality rates than White women despite lower incidence. The aim of this study is to investigate how much of the mortality disparity can be attributed to racial differences in natural history, uptake of mammography screening, and use of adjuvant therapy. METHODS: Two simulation models use common national race, and age-specific data for incidence, screening and treatment dissemination, stage distributions, survival, and competing mortality from 1975 to 2010. Treatment effectiveness and mammography sensitivity are assumed to be the same for both races. We sequentially substituted Black parameters into the White model to identify parameters that drive the higher mortality for Black women in the current time period. RESULTS: Both models accurately reproduced observed breast cancer incidence, stage and tumor size distributions, and breast cancer mortality for White women. The higher mortality for Black women could be attributed to differences in natural history parameters (26-44%), use of adjuvant therapy (11-19%), and uptake of mammography screening (7-8%), leaving 38% to 46% unexplained. CONCLUSION: Black women appear to have benefited less from cancer control advances than White women, with a greater race-related gap in the use of adjuvant therapy than screening. However, a greater portion of the disparity in mortality appears to be due to differences in natural history and undetermined factors. IMPACT: Breast cancer mortality may be reduced substantially by ensuring that Black women receive equal adjuvant treatment and screening as White women. More research on racial variation in breast cancer biology and treatment utilization is needed. �2011 AACR.;Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2011 Jan.20(1):112-22. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-10-0944.

This article addresses three equity-efficiency trade-off methods proposed in the literature. Moreover, it demonstrates their impact on cost-effectiveness analyses in current breast cancer control options for women of different age groups. METHODS: We adapted an existing breast cancer model to estimate cost-effectiveness and equity effects of breast cancer interventions. We applied three methods to quantify the equity-efficiency trade-offs: 1) targeting specific groups, comparing disparities at baseline and in different intervention scenarios. 2) equity weighting, valuing low and high health gains differently. and 3) multicriteria decision analysis, weighing multiple equity and efficiency criteria. We compared the resulting composite league tables of all approaches. RESULTS: The approaches show that a comprehensive breast cancer program, including screening, for women below 75 years of age was most attractive in both the group targeting approach and the equity weighting approach. Such control programs would reduce disparities with 56% and at euro1908 per equity quality-adjusted life-year gained. In the multicriteria approach, a comprehensive treatment program for women below 75 years of age and treatment in stage III breast cancer were most attractive, with both an 82% selection probability, followed by screening programs for the two age groups. CONCLUSION: In the three equity weighing approaches, targeting women below 75 years of age was more cost-effective and led to more equitable distributions of health. This likely is similar in other fatal diseases with similar age distributions. The approaches may lead to different outcomes in nonfatal disease.;Value Health. 2010 Aug.13(5):573-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1524-4733.2010.00718.x.

This model was developed within the Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Network (CISNET) consortium. METHOD: A Monte Carlo simulation is developed to generate the life history of individual breast cancer patients by using CISNET base case inputs that describe the secular trend in breast cancer risk, dissemination patterns for screening mammography and adjuvant treatment, and death from causes other than breast cancer. The model generates the patient's age, tumor size and stage at detection, mode of detection, age at death, and cause of death (breast cancer versus other) based in part on assumptions on the natural history of breast cancer. Outcomes from multiple birth cohorts are summarized in terms of breast cancer mortality rates by calendar year. RESULT: Predicted breast cancer mortality rates follow the general shape of U.S. breast cancer mortality rates from 1975 to 1995 but level off after 1995 as opposed to following an observed decline. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the impact adjuvant treatment may be underestimated given the lack of data on temporal variation in treatment efficacy. CONCLUSION: We developed a simulation model that uses CISNET base case inputs and closely, but not exactly, reproduces U.S. breast cancer mortality rates.

MODELING APPROACH: We use an event-driven continuous-time state transition model. Women who are destined to develop breast cancer may be screen detected, present with symptoms, or die of other causes before cancer is diagnosed. At presentation, the cancer has a stage assigned on the basis of mode of detection. Cancers are assumed to be estrogen receptor (ER) positive or negative. Data on screening and treatment diffusion are based on national datasets. other parameters are based on a synthesis of the evidence available in the literature. MODEL METHODS: The model is calibrated to predict incidence and stage distribution (in situ, local, regional, and distant). Other than screening or treatment, background events that affect mortality are not explicitly modeled but are captured in the deviation between model projections of mortality trends and actual trends. We assume that: 1) tumors progress more slowly in older age groups, 2) screen- and clinically detected disease have the same survival conditional on age and stage, 3) women do not die of breast cancer within the ""lead time"" period, 4) screening benefits are captured by shifts in stage at diagnosis, 4) tamoxifen benefits only ER-positive women, and 5) preclinical sojourn time and dwell times in each of the clinical stages are stochastically independent. MODEL RESULTS: Dissemination of screening and therapeutic advances had a substantial impact on mortality trends. We estimate that, by the year 2000, diffusion of screening lowered mortality by 12.4% and treatment improvements and dissemination lowered mortality by 14.6%. CONCLUSIONS: Models such as this one can be useful to translate clinical trial findings to general populations. This model can also be used inform policy debates about how to best achieve targeted reductions in breast cancer morbidity and mortality.";J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr. 2006.(36):47-55.;Mandelblatt J1, Schechter CB, Lawrence W, Yi B, Cullen J.;17032894;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Adult,Age Distribution,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use*,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy*,Breast Neoplasms/mortality,Chemotherapy, Adjuvant,Disease Progression,Female,Humans,Incidence,Mammography/statistics & numerical data,Mass Screening/statistics & numerical data*,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical*,Neoplasm Staging,Predictive Value of Tests,Sensitivity and Specificity,Stochastic Processes,Survival Rate,United States/epidemiology,K05 CA96940/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,U01-CA88293A/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;Early Detection of Cancer, Combined Modality Therapy, Breast Neoplasms;;model valid;0.364"one",The Wisconsin Breast Cancer Epidemiology Simulation Model.;"Abstract The Wisconsin Breast Cancer Epidemiology Simulation Model is a discrete-event, stochastic simulation model using a systems-science modeling approach to replicate breast cancer incidence and mortality in the U.S. population from 1975 to 2000.

Our goal is to apportion this decline between screening and therapy and to be able to state with some certainty that these interventions affected this decline. METHODS: We started with an age-appropriate population of 2,000,000 women in 1975 and monitored these women through 2000. On the basis of population data each year, we assigned screening and breast cancer to women. If a woman was diagnosed with breast cancer, we simulated a lifetime for her with death from breast cancer, and we modified this lifetime depending on the use of adjuvant therapy and whether the cancer was screen-detected. A woman's lifetime was taken as the minimum of her lifetime with death from breast cancer and her simulated natural lifetime. We used Bayesian simulation modeling, which allows for associating probability distributions with our estimates. RESULTS: We calculated the probabilities that screening mammography and adjuvant therapy contributed to the observed decline in BCM to be 90% and 99%, respectively. The posterior mean reduction in BCM due to screening is 10.6% +/- 5.7% and due to therapy is 19.5% +/- 5.4%. The decrease in the hazard of BCM due to tamoxifen use for ER-positive tumors is 37% +/- 14% and that due to adjuvant (nontaxane) chemotherapy is 15% +/- 14%. DISCUSSION: The spread in our posterior distributions reflect the uncertainty present in the data sources available to us.

Each of the groups has chosen a different modeling methodology without purposeful attempt to be in contrast with each other. The seven groups have met biannually since November 2000 to discuss their methodology and results. This article investigates the differences in methodology. To facilitate this comparison, each of the groups submitted a description of their model into a uniformly structured web based 'model profiler'. Six of the seven models simulate a preclinical natural history that cannot be observed directly with parameters estimated from published evidence concerning screening and therapy effects. The remaining model regards published evidence on intervention effects as prior information and updates that with information from the US population in a Bayesian type analysis. In general, the differences between the models appear to be small, particularly among the models driven by natural history assumptions. However, we demonstrate that such apparently small differences can have a large impact on surveillance of population trends.

In this paper, we describe the trends in the usage of adjuvant systemic treatment in the period 1975-1997 in the Netherlands. The main aim of our study was to assess the effects of adjuvant tamoxifen and polychemotherapy on breast cancer mortality, compared to the effects of the mammography screening programme. The computer simulation model MIcrosimulation SCreening ANalysis, which simulates demography, natural history of breast cancer and screening effects, was used to estimate the effects. Use of adjuvant therapy increased over time, but since 1990 it remained rather stable. Nowadays, adjuvant therapy is given to 88% of node-positive patients aged 50-69 years, while less than 10% of node-negative patients receive any kind of adjuvant treatment. Adjuvant treatment is given independent of the mode of detection (adjusted by nodal status and size). We predict that the reduction in breast cancer mortality due to adjuvant therapy is 7% in women aged 55-74 years, while the reduction due to screening, which was first implemented in women aged 50-69 years in 1990-97, will be 28-30% in 2007. In conclusion, although adjuvant systemic therapy can reduce breast cancer mortality rates, it is anticipated to be less than the mortality reduction caused by mammography screening.;Br J Cancer. 2004 Jul 19.91(2):242-7.;Vervoort MM1, Draisma G, Fracheboud J, van de Poll-Franse LV, de Koning HJ.;15213715;Age Distribution,Aged,Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use*,Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy*,Breast Neoplasms/mortality*,Chemotherapy, Adjuvant/trends*,Computer Simulation,Drug Therapy, Combination,Drug Utilization/trends,Female,Humans,Mammography/trends,Mass Screening,Middle Aged,Netherlands/epidemiology,Survival Rate,Tamoxifen/therapeutic use*,Antineoplastic Agents,Tamoxifen;Early Detection of Cancer, Combined Modality Therapy, Breast Neoplasms;;model valid;0.292"not valid",Interval Colorectal Cancers following Guaiac Fecal Occult Blood Testing in the Ontario ColonCancerCheck Program.;Abstract BACKGROUND: This work examines the occurrence of interval colorectal cancers (CRCs) in the Ontario ColonCancerCheck (CCC) program. We define interval CRC as CRC diagnosed within 2 years following normal guaiac fecal occult blood testing (gFOBT). METHODS: Persons aged 50-74 who completed a baseline CCC gFOBT kit in 2008 and 2009, without a prior history of CRC, or recent colonoscopy, flexible sigmoidoscopy, or gFOBT, were identified. Rates of CRC following positive and normal results at baseline and subsequent gFOBT screens were computed and overall survival was compared between those following positive and normal results. RESULTS: Interval CRC was diagnosed within 24 months following the baseline screen among 0.16% of normals and following the subsequent screen among 0.18% of normals. Interval cancers comprised 38.70% of CRC following the baseline screen and 50.86% following the subsequent screen. Adjusting for age and sex, the hazard ratio (HR) for death following interval cancer compared to CRC following positive result was 1.65 (1.32, 2.05) following the first screen and 1.71 (1.00, 2.91) following the second screen.

AIMS: We aimed to assess and compare prognosis of patients with screen-detected CRC and symptom-detected CRC. METHODS: Overall and CRC specific mortality over a median follow-up of 4.8 years was assessed according to mode of diagnosis (symptoms, screening colonoscopy, fecal occult blood test [FOBT], other) in a multi-center cohort of 2,450 CRC patients aged 50-79 years recruited in Germany in 2003-2010. RESULTS: 68%, 11% and 10% were detected by symptoms, screening colonoscopy and FOBT, respectively. The screen-detected cancers had a more favorable stage distribution than the symptom-detected cancers (68% versus 50% in stage I or II). Age- and sex adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of total mortality with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) compared to symptom-detected cancers were 0.35 (0.24-0.50) and 0.36 (0.25-0.53) for screening colonoscopy and FOBT detected CRCs, respectively. HRs were only slightly attenuated and remained highly significant after adjustment for stage and multiple other covariates (0.50 (0.34-0.73) and 0.54 (0.37-0.80), respectively). Even stronger associations were seen for CRC specific mortality. Patients with screen-detected stage III CRC had as good CRC specific survival as patients with symptom-detected stage I or II CRC. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with screen-detected CRC have a very good prognosis far beyond the level explained by their more favorable stage distribution. Mode of detection is an important, easy-to-obtain proxy indicator for favorable diagnosis beyond earlier stage at diagnosis and as such may be useful for risk stratification in treatment decisions.;Oncotarget. 2016 Jul 12.7(28):44695-44704. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.9412.;Brenner H1,2,3, Jansen L1, Ulrich A4, Chang-Claude J5, Hoffmeister M1.;27213584;Multicenter Study,Aged,Cohort Studies,Colonoscopy,Colorectal Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Colorectal Neoplasms/mortality,Early Detection of Cancer/methods*,Early Detection of Cancer/statistics & numerical data,Female,Germany,Humans,Male,Mass Screening/methods*,Mass Screening/statistics & numerical data,Middle Aged,Multivariate Analysis,Occult Blood,Prognosis,Proportional Hazards Models,Survival Analysis,Survival Rate;Early Detection of Cancer, Combined Modality Therapy, Colorectal Neoplasms;;model valid;0.196"one",The economic evaluation of screening for colorectal cancer: Case of Iran.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Given increasing rates of colorectal cancer (CRC) in countries with intermediate incidence rates, the decision to implement population-based screening must consider the trade-off between high costs and a relatively low yield. We estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 10 strategies for colorectal cancer screening, as well as no screening, incorporating quality of life, noncompliance, and data on the costs and benefits of chemotherapy in Iran. METHODS: We used a Markov model to measure the costs and quality-adjusted life expectancy of 50-year-old average-risk Iranian without screening and with screening by each test. In this study, we populated the model with data from the ministry of health and published literature. We considered costs from the perspective of a health insurance organization, with inflation to the 2011 Iranian Rial converted to US dollars. We focused on three tests of the 10 strategies considered, currently being used for population screening in some Iranian provinces (Mazandaran Kerman, Golestan, Ardabil, and Tehran): low-sensitivity guaiac fecal occult blood test, performed annually. fecal immunochemical test, performed annually. and colonoscopy, performed every 10 years. RESULTS: These strategies reduced the incidence of colorectal cancer by 39%, 60%, and 76% and mortality by 50%, 69%, and 78%, respectively, compared with no screening. These strategies generated ICER (incremental cost-effectiveness ratios) of $9067, $654, and $8700 per QALY (quality-adjusted life year), respectively. Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the influence of various parameters on the cost-effectiveness of screening. The results were robust to probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Colonoscopy every 10 years yielded the greatest net health benefit. CONCLUSIONS: Screening for colorectal cancer is cost-effective over conventional levels of WTP (Willingness to Pay). Annual high-sensitivity fecal occult blood testing, such as a fecal immunochemical test, or colonoscopy every 10 years offer the best value for the money in Iran.;Clin Lab. 2013.59(5-6):667-74.;Barouni M1, Ghaderi H, Shahmoradi MK.;23865368;Colonoscopy,Colorectal Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Colorectal Neoplasms/economics,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Early Detection of Cancer/economics*,Early Detection of Cancer/methods*,Female,Guaiac,Humans,Iran,Male,Markov Chains,Occult Blood,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,Guaiac;Early Detection of Cancer, Combined Modality Therapy, Colorectal Neoplasms;;model valid;0.756"one",The role of physician reminders in faecal occult blood testing for colorectal cancer screening.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer screening in the form of faecal occult blood (FOB) testing can significantly reduce the burden of this disease and has been used as early as the 1970s. Effective involvement of GPs along with reminding physicians prior to seeing a patient may improve uptake. OBJECTIVE: This article is a systematic review of published literature examining the uptake of FOB testing after physician reminders as part of the colorectal cancer screening process. METHODS: Electronic databases were searched from January 1975 to October 2010. All studies comparing physician reminders (Rem) with controls (NRem) were identified. A meta-analysis was performed to obtain a summary outcome. RESULTS: Five comparative studies involving 25 287 patients were analyzed. There were 12 641 patients were in the Rem and 12 646 in the NRem group. All five studies obtained a higher percentage uptake when physician reminders were given. However, in only two of the studies were the percentage uptake significantly higher. There was significant heterogeneity among trials (I2 = 95%). The combined increase in FOB test uptake was not statistically significant (random effects model: risk difference = 6.6%, 95% CI: -2-14.7%. z = 1.59, P = 0.112). CONCLUSION: Reminding physicians about those patients due for FOB testing may not improve the effectiveness of a colorectal cancer screening programme. Further studies are required and should focus on areas where there is a lower baseline uptake and areas with high levels of deprivation.;Eur J Gen Pract. 2011 Dec.17(4):221-8. doi: 10.3109/13814788.2011.601412.

OBJECTIVE: To describe and quantify the endoscopic findings, survival, and predictors of mortality of elderly persons after colonoscopy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Retrospective cohort study of persons aged>or=75 years who underwent colonoscopy in 1999 and 2000 at a U.S. Veterans Affairs facility and urban county hospital. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Advanced neoplasms were defined as colorectal cancer (CRC), polyp with high-grade dysplasia, villous histologic features, or tubular adenoma>or=1 cm. Comorbidity was measured with the Charlson comorbidity index. Subjects were followed until death or study closure. RESULTS: Of 469 eligible subjects, 65 were excluded and 404 were included in the study. Fifty-nine of 404 (15%) had an advanced neoplasm, including 8 (2%) with CRC. There were 167 deaths (41%). the mean overall survival was 4.1+/-0.1 years (median 5.95 years). A symptomatic indication for colonoscopy was not predictive of death. Mortality was predicted by age (hazard ratio 1.16 for each year increase beyond age 75 years, 95% CI 1.07-1.3, P=.0003) and Charlson score (hazard ratio 8.3 for each point increase, 95% CI 1.4-48.5, P=.02). The median survival of patients aged 75 to 79 years was >5 years if the Charlson score was <or=4. Among patients aged>or=80 years, the median survival was <5 years regardless of Charlson score. LIMITATIONS: Retrospective design. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of elders, age and comorbidity were predictors of death. The protective effect of younger age lessens as comorbidity increases. These findings may have important implications for CRC screening and surveillance in elders.;Gastrointest Endosc. 2007 Sep.66(3):544-50.;Kahi CJ1, Azzouz F, Juliar BE, Imperiale TF.;17725944;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adenoma, Villous/diagnosis,Adenoma, Villous/mortality,Adenoma, Villous/pathology,Adenoma, Villous/surgery,Age Factors,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Cause of Death*,Cohort Studies,Colonic Polyps/diagnosis,Colonic Polyps/mortality,Colonic Polyps/pathology,Colonic Polyps/surgery,Colonoscopy*,Colorectal Neoplasms/diagnosis,Colorectal Neoplasms/mortality*,Colorectal Neoplasms/pathology,Colorectal Neoplasms/surgery,Comorbidity,Female,Humans,Life Tables,Male,Mass Screening*,Neoplasm Staging,Occult Blood,Proportional Hazards Models,Retrospective Studies,Risk Factors,Survival Analysis,K24 DK02756/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States;Early Detection of Cancer, Combined Modality Therapy, Colorectal Neoplasms;;model valid;0.232"not valid",Microsimulation model predicts survival benefit of radiofrequency ablation and stereotactic body radiotherapy versus radiotherapy for treating inoperable stage I non-small cell lung cancer.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: A subset of patients with stage IA and IB non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is ineligible for surgical resection and undergoes radiation therapy. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and stereotactic body radiotherapy are newer potentially attractive alternative therapies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We added RFA and stereotactic body radiotherapy treatment modules to a microsimulation model that simulates lung cancer's natural history, detection, and treatment. Natural history parameters were previously estimated via calibration against tumor registry data and cohort studies. the model was validated with screening study and cohort data. RFA model parameters were calibrated against 2-year survival from the Radiofrequency Ablation of Pulmonary Tumor Response Evaluation (RAPTURE) study, and stereotactic body radiotherapy model parameters were calibrated against 3-year survival from a phase 2 prospective trial. We simulated lifetime histories of identical patients with early-stage NSCLC who were ineligible for resection, who were treated with radiation therapy, RFA, or stereotactic body radiotherapy under a range of scenarios. From 5,000,000 simulated individuals, we selected a cohort of patients with stage I medically inoperable cancer for analysis (n = 2056 per treatment scenario). Main outcomes were life expectancy gains. RESULTS: RFA or stereotactic body radiotherapy treatment in patients with peripheral stage IA or IB NSCLC who were nonoperative candidates resulted in life expectancy gains of 1.71 and 1.46 life-years, respectively, compared with universal radiation therapy. A strategy where patients with central tumors underwent stereotactic body radiotherapy and those with peripheral tumors underwent RFA resulted in a gain of 2.02 life-years compared with universal radiation therapy. Findings were robust with respect to changes in model parameters. CONCLUSION: Microsimulation modeling results suggest that RFA and stereotactic body radiotherapy could provide life expectancy gains to patients with stage IA or IB NSCLC who are ineligible for resection.;AJR Am J Roentgenol. 2013 May.200(5):1020-7. doi: 10.2214/AJR.12.8968.;Tramontano AC1, Cipriano LE, Kong CY, Shepard JA, Lanuti M, Gazelle GS, McMahon PM.;23617484;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/mortality*,Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/therapy*,Catheter Ablation/mortality*,Catheter Ablation/statistics & numerical data,Combined Modality Therapy/mortality,Humans,Lung Neoplasms/mortality*,Lung Neoplasms/therapy*,Outcome Assessment (Health Care),Pneumonectomy/mortality,Prognosis,Proportional Hazards Models*,Radiosurgery/mortality*,Radiosurgery/statistics & numerical data,Risk Assessment/methods,Survival Analysis,Survival Rate,Treatment Outcome,K25 CA133141/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,U01 CA152956/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,R01 CA097337/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,R00 CA126147/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,R01 CA97337/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,K99/R00 CA126147/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;Early Detection of Cancer, Combined Modality Therapy, Lung Neoplasms;;model valid;0.188"not valid",[Approach to prostate cancer in men older than 75 years: active or passive?].;Abstract Based on the exponential aging of the population and the increasing life expectancy in industrialized western countries, prostate cancer (PCa) in elderly men is becoming a disease of increasing significance. Consensus exists that men over the age of 75 years should not be screened for PCa. however, higher age as a single parameter should not exclude men from being diagnosed with prostate cancer and treated accordingly. It is well-known that overdiagnosis and overtreatment are frequent in this age group. Competing mortality risks of men older than 75 years may supersede the risk of dying from PCa several fold. Both the treating physician and the patient himself should therefore balance the possible risks and benefits of diagnosing and treating prostate cancer concerning the impact on quality of life. This is of special importance when taking into account that the complication rates of curative treatment modalities are higher in older patients than in younger men and that hormonal treatment might have negative effects especially in older men.Age, existing comorbidities, cognitive and physical status in combination with specific tumor parameters are useful tools for an individualized treatment.Therapy should be considered for healthy, active men aged 75 years or older who present with high-risk PCa and/or with a PSA doubling time <12 months. Elderly men who are unfit or have low to intermediate risk PCa will most likely not benefit from treatment.;Urologe A. 2012 Oct.51(10):1368-74. doi: 10.1007/s00120-012-3011-6.;Spahn M1, Haeni K.;23053031;English Abstract,Age Distribution,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use*,Comorbidity,Germany/epidemiology,Humans,Male,Patient Selection,Prevalence,Proportional Hazards Models,Prostatectomy/mortality*,Prostatectomy/statistics & numerical data*,Prostatic Neoplasms/mortality*,Prostatic Neoplasms/surgery*,Risk Factors,Survival Analysis,Survival Rate,Treatment Outcome,Antineoplastic Agents;Early Detection of Cancer, Combined Modality Therapy, Prostatic Neoplasms;;model valid;0.18"valid",Estimating all cancers incidence with the MIAMOD model: a new method to include multiple tumors.;Abstract AIMS AND BACKGROUND: The MIAMOD method has been widely applied to derive regional and national cancer burden estimates. The method is based on a back-calculation approach using cancer-specific mortality and relative survival to derive expected incident and prevalent cases. Multiple tumors occurring in the same site for the same person (for example colon-colon) can be estimated just once. This has little effect on cancer-specific estimates, whereas it limits all cancers-combined estimates, where only cancer cases, rather than cancer diagnoses, can be accounted for by the method. The aim of this article is to present a specific strategy of application of the MIAMOD method to all cancers sites, which better approximates an estimate of 'cancer diagnoses'. METHODS: The strategy consists of breaking down the estimation process in separate applications to the most frequent cancer sites and to a 'remainder-site', given by all malignant sites except the previous ones. The separate estimates are then summed up to derive the overall quantities for all cancers combined. Cancer-specific mortality in the years 1985-2004 in the Tuscany cancer registry area (about 1,200,000 inhabitants) and relative survival data in the same area and periods (end of follow-up, 31 December 2006) were used to produce the estimates, which were then tested using observed incidence data in the same area and period. RESULTS: The standard application of the MIAMOD method underestimates all cancer incidence for both sexes. The mean relative difference between observed and expected incident cases is -14.8% for males and -17.2% for females. With the alternative method, the same mean relative difference drops to -8.2% for males and -6.1% for females. CONCLUSIONS: The study provides a strategy to reduce a structural limit of the MIAMOD method in estimating the total burden of cancer disease.;Tumori. 2012 May-Jun.98(3):296-302. doi: 10.1700/1125.12395.;Ventura L1, Miccinesi G, Sacchettini C, De Angelis R.;22825503;Adolescent,Adult,Age Distribution,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology,Colorectal Neoplasms/epidemiology,Female,Humans,Incidence,Italy/epidemiology,Lung Neoplasms/epidemiology,Male,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical*,Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Neoplasms/mortality,Population Surveillance,Prostatic Neoplasms/epidemiology,Registries,Sex Distribution,Stomach Neoplasms/epidemiology,Survival Rate;Lung Neoplasms, Prostatic Neoplasms, Primary Prevention,Breast Neoplasms, Lung Neoplasms;;model valid;0.188"not valid",Individualizing the risks and benefits of postmenopausal hormone therapy.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: The objective was to develop an individualized risk-benefit model quantifying the impact of combined use of estrogen and progestogen on chronic diseases. DESIGN: The study population consisted of women, aged 40+, prescribed postmenopausal hormone therapy (HT) in the UK General Practice Research Database (N > 200,000). Individualized risks of fracture, colorectal cancer, diabetes mellitus, myocardial infarction, deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, breast cancer, and stroke were estimated using Cox regression. Relative rates from the Women's Health Initiative trial were used to estimate attributable risks (ie, excess risks) in a risk-benefit simulation model. RESULTS: Risks and benefits increased with age and length of HT use. HT use for 5 years initiated at age 45 increased the absolute risk of myocardial infarction by 0.04% and breast cancer by 0.3% and reduced the risk of hip fracture by 0.03%. Comparably, 5-year HT use started at age 75 led to increases in the risks of myocardial infarction and breast cancer (+0.4% and +0.2%, respectively) and reduced that of hip fracture (-0.9%). There was considerable heterogeneity in the risks and benefits of HT. In most of the younger HT users, the frequency of risks exceeded that of the benefits, although the absolute excess risks were small. In HT users aged 70+, 62.4% experienced more benefits than risks, whereas 37.6% experienced more risks than benefits. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of beneficial and adverse effects of HT on chronic diseases was low in younger women, whereas the ratio of these risks and benefits varied substantially among the older users. However, the study could not asses the effects of HT on menopausal symptoms and quality of life, benefits more likely to be observed among younger women.;Menopause. 2008 Mar-Apr.15(2):374-81.;van Staa TP1, Cooper C, Barlow D, Leufkens HG.;17882009;Adult,Age Factors,Cardiovascular Diseases/epidemiology,Chronic Disease/prevention & control*,Cohort Studies,Colorectal Neoplasms/epidemiology,Database Management Systems,Estrogen Replacement Therapy/adverse effects*,Female,Hip Fractures/epidemiology,Humans,Middle Aged,Postmenopause/drug effects*,Postmenopause/physiology,Proportional Hazards Models,Risk Assessment,United Kingdom/epidemiology,G0400491/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom,MC_UP_A620_1014/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom;Breast Neoplasms, Lung Neoplasms, Primary Prevention;;model valid;0.212"not valid",The benefits and costs of tamoxifen for breast cancer prevention.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effects of key uncertainties on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of breast cancer prevention with tamoxifen. METHODS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of tamoxifen therapy relative to placebo was estimated using decision analysis with Markov modelling of health states, outcomes and costs for a simulated cohort of women at high risk for breast cancer. Relative effects of tamoxifen's benefits and harms were estimated from meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials. Cost estimates were based on Australian treatment patterns and costs. The main outcome measure was cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained with costs and effects discounted at a 5% annual rate. RESULTS: Tamoxifen therapy over five years reduces the incidence of breast cancer by approximately 1.4%, which is offset by an increase in endometrial cancer of 0.7% and pulmonary embolism of 0.2%. If the reduction is permanent (preventing new breast cancers emerging over five years and no further treatment effect thereafter), the model estimates an increase in life expectancy of 0.057 QALYs and an extra cost of $2,193. or $38,271/QALY gained. A model assuming further treatment effects of tamoxifen preventing new breast cancers emerging for up to 10 years results in an incremental cost of $19,354/QALY. However, if five years of tamoxifen therapy merely delays when these breast cancers appear (such that by 10 years there is no longer a reduced incidence), the incremental cost per QALY saved is estimated to be $199,149. CONCLUSIONS: Tamoxifen is potentially cost-effective in preventing breast cancer in women at high risk. However, its cost-effectiveness as a preventive therapy is highly sensitive to whether these cancers are permanently prevented or their clinical presentation is only delayed. Long-term follow-up in randomised controlled trials is therefore crucial in forming health policy.;Aust N Z J Public Health. 2003.27(1):34-40.;Eckermann SD1, Martin AJ, Stockler MR, Simes RJ.;14705265;Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/adverse effects,Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/economics,Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/therapeutic use*,Australia/epidemiology,Breast Neoplasms/economics,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology,Breast Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Cost-Benefit Analysis*,Decision Support Techniques,Female,Humans,Incidence,Markov Chains*,Quality-Adjusted Life Years*,Tamoxifen/adverse effects,Tamoxifen/economics,Tamoxifen/therapeutic use*,Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal,Tamoxifen;Breast Neoplasms, Lung Neoplasms, Primary Prevention;;model valid;0.612"not valid",Cancer prevalence in European registry areas.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Information on cancer prevalence is of major importance for health planning and resource allocation. However, systematic information on cancer prevalence is largely unavailable. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-eight population-based cancer registries from 17 European countries, participating in EUROPREVAL, provided data on almost 3 million cancer patients diagnosed from 1970 to 1992. Standardised data collection and validation procedures were used and the whole data set was analysed using proven methodology. The prevalence of stomach, colon, rectum, lung, breast, cervix uteri, corpus uteri and prostate cancer, as well as of melanoma of skin, Hodgkin's disease, leukaemia and all malignant neoplasms combined, were estimated for the end of 1992. RESULTS: There were large differences between countries in the prevalence of all cancers combined. estimates ranged from 1170 per 100000 in the Polish cancer registration areas to 3050 per 100000 in southern Sweden. For most cancers, the Swedish, Swiss, German and Italian areas had high prevalence, and the Polish, Estonian, Slovakian and Slovenian areas had low prevalence. Of the total prevalent cases, 61% were women and 57% were 65 years of age or older. Cases diagnosed within 2 years of the reference date formed 22% of all prevalent cases. Breast cancer accounted for 34% of all prevalent cancers in females and colorectal cancer for 15% in males. Prevalence tended to be high where cancer incidence was high, but the prevalence was highest in countries where survival was also high. Prevalence was low where general mortality was high (correlation between general mortality and the prevalence of all cancers = -0.64) and high where gross domestic product was high (correlation = +0.79). Thus, the richer areas of Europe had higher prevalence, suggesting that prevalence will increase with economic development. CONCLUSIONS: EUROPREVAL is the largest project on prevalence conducted to date. It has provided complete and accurate estimates of cancer prevalence in Europe, constituting essential information for cancer management. The expected increases in prevalence with economic development will require more resources. allocation to primary prevention should therefore be prioritised.;Ann Oncol. 2002 Jun.13(6):840-65.;Micheli A1, Mugno E, Krogh V, Quinn MJ, Coleman M, Hakulinen T, Gatta G, Berrino F, Capocaccia R.

METHODS: Using a Markov model and decision analytic techniques, the long-term costs and outcomes of five treatment and secondary prevention strategies for osteoporosis were compared: 'no intervention', alendronate, etidronate, risedronate, and raloxifene. The base case analysis examined postmenopausal (65 year old) osteoporotic women without prior fracture. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was used to incorporate the impact of parameter uncertainty, and deterministic sensitivity analysis (DSA) was used to compare alternative patient populations and modeling assumptions. Life years and Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) were used as measures of effectiveness. RESULTS: In the base case analysis, risedronate was dominated by etidronate and alendronate. Alendronate and etidronate were projected to have similar costs and QALYs, and the efficiency frontier was represented by 'no intervention', etidronate, alendronate, and raloxifene (Can$32 571, Can$38 623 and Can$114 070 per QALY respectively). Alternative assumptions of raloxifene's impact on CHD and breast cancer, alternative discount rates and alternative patient risk factors (e.g., starting age of therapy, CHD risk, and prior fracture risk) had significant impacts on the overall cost-effectiveness results for both the bisphosphonates and raloxifene. DISCUSSION: Using conventionally quoted benchmarks and compared to no therapy, alendronate, etidronate, and raloxifene would all be considered cost-effective alternatives for treating women with osteoporosis. Potential limitations of this study include the usual caveats and cautions associated with long-term projection models and the fact that not all inputs into the model are Canadian data sources.;Curr Med Res Opin. 2006 Jul.22(7):1425-36.;Goeree R1, Blackhouse G, Adachi J.;16834841;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Aged,Alendronate/economics*,Alendronate/therapeutic use*,Bone Density Conservation Agents/economics*,Bone Density Conservation Agents/therapeutic use*,Canada,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Decision Support Techniques,Etidronic Acid/analogs & derivatives*,Etidronic Acid/economics*,Etidronic Acid/therapeutic use*,Female,Humans,Markov Chains,Osteoporosis, Postmenopausal/drug therapy*,Osteoporosis, Postmenopausal/economics,Raloxifene Hydrochloride/economics*,Raloxifene Hydrochloride/therapeutic use*,Risedronate Sodium,Bone Density Conservation Agents,Raloxifene Hydrochloride,Etidronic Acid,Risedronate Sodium,Alendronate;Breast Neoplasms, Prostatic Neoplasms, Primary Prevention;;model valid;0.512"not valid",Incorporating calibrated model parameters into sensitivity analyses: deterministic and probabilistic approaches.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine how calibration uncertainty affects the overall uncertainty of a mathematical model and to evaluate potential drivers of calibration uncertainty. METHODS: A lifetime Markov model of the natural history of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and cervical disease was developed to assess the cost effectiveness of a hypothetical HPV vaccine. Published data on cervical cancer incidence and mortality and prevalence of pre-cursor lesions were used as endpoints to calibrate the age- and HPV-type-specific transition probabilities between health states using the Nelder-Mead simplex method of calibration. A conventional probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was performed to assess uncertainty in vaccine efficacy, cost and utility estimates. To quantify the uncertainty around calibrated transition probabilities, a second PSA (calibration PSA) was performed using 25 distinct combinations of objective functions and starting simplexes. RESULTS: The initial calibration produced an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $US 4300 per QALY for vaccination compared with no vaccination, and the conventional PSA gave a 95% credible interval of dominant to $US 9800 around this estimate (2005 values). The 95% credible interval for the ICERs in the calibration PSA ranged from $US 1000 to $US 37,700. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with a conventional PSA, the calibration PSA results reveal a greater level of uncertainty in cost-effectiveness results.

The cost perspective is that of a private (commercial) insurer, while the value perspective includes survival past age 65 years, when most of the US population is insured by Medicare. We focused on colonoscopy because it is not only diagnostic but also therapeutic. because positive results on other screening tests generally are followed up with colonoscopy. and to build on previous study results that colonoscopy is ultimately more cost-effective than other screening, even considering its expense. STUDY DESIGN: Monte Carlo simulation. METHODS: Using a large multi-state cancer registry, a large national administrative claims database, and a model of CRC development based on published clinical literature, we estimated the impact of screening with colonoscopy on incidence of CRC, aggregate cost of colonoscopies and CRC, and life-years saved. RESULTS: Assuming 2013 commercial reimbursement rates for screening and treatment, we found that increasing screening adherence from 50% to 100% would cost about $3 per member per month (2013 US$) and reduce CRC treatment costs by about $1 per member per month. The cost per life-year saved is approximately $12,000, an amount that is much lower than for cervical or breast cancer screening and comparable to lung cancer screening. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that commercial insurers and employers should promote CRC screening as a high-value service. Promoting such screening through high-quality, low-cost providers would be an exemplar of efficient system innovation.;Am J Manag Care. 2015 Jul 1.21(7):e430-8.;Fitch K1, Pyenson B, Blumen H, Weisman T, Small A.;26295271;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Colonoscopy/economics*,Colorectal Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Colorectal Neoplasms/economics*,Colorectal Neoplasms/epidemiology,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Early Detection of Cancer/economics*,Early Detection of Cancer/methods,Female,Humans,Insurance Claim Review,Male,Middle Aged,Monte Carlo Method,United States; Early Detection of Cancer,Lung Neoplasms, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms,Breast Neoplasms, Lung Neoplasms;;model valid;0.564"not valid",Probabilities of dying from cancer and other causes in French cancer patients based on an unbiased estimator of net survival: a study of five common cancers.;"Abstract BACKGROUND: Net survival is the survival that would be observed if cancer were the only possible cause of death. Although it is an important epidemiological tool allowing temporal or geographical comparisons, it cannot inform on the ""crude"" probability of death of cancer patients. i.e., when taking into account other possible causes of deaths. METHODS: In this work, we provide estimates of the crude probabilities of death from cancer and from other causes as well as the probability of being alive up to ten years after cancer diagnosis according to the age and year of diagnosis. Based on a flexible excess hazard model providing unbiased estimates of net survival, our methodology avoids the pitfalls associated with the use of the cause of death. We used data from FRANCIM, the French network of cancer registries, and studied five common cancer sites: head and neck, breast, prostate, lung, and colorectal cancers. RESULTS: For breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers, the impact of the other causes on the total probability of death increased with the age at diagnosis whereas it remained negligible for lung and head and neck cancers whatever the age. For breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer, the more recently was the cancer diagnosed, the less was the probability of death from cancer. CONCLUSION: The crude probability of death is an intuitive concept that may prove particularly useful in choosing an appropriate treatment, or refining the indication of a screening strategy by allowing the clinician to estimate the proportion of cancer patients who will die specifically from cancer.

The impact of imaging on these outcomes can be ascertained from observational and modelling studies, frequently performed to evaluate cost-effectiveness. Examples where incorporation of imaging into cancer care can be shown to improve survival include breast cancer screening, characterization of solitary pulmonary nodules, staging of non-small cell lung cancer, treatment response assessment in Hodgkin lymphoma, postoperative surveillance of colorectal cancer and selective internal radiation therapy of colorectal liver metastases. Modelling suggests the greatest opportunities for improvements in survival through imaging detection of cancer may lie in the investigation of mildly symptomatic patients. For applications where the improvements in survival are more modest, use of imaging frequently has additional demonstrable benefits including reductions in health care expenditure.;Cancer Imaging. 2011 Oct 3.11 Spec No A:S86-92. doi: 10.1102/1470-7330.2011.9022.;Miles K1.;22185954;Review,Colorectal Neoplasms/diagnosis,Colorectal Neoplasms/mortality,Health Care Costs,Humans,Markov Chains,Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/diagnosis,Neoplasm Staging,Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Neoplasms/mortality*,Neoplasms/pathology,Treatment Outcome;Breast Neoplasms, Lung Neoplasms, Early Detection of Cancer;;model valid;0.192"valid",Unifying screening processes within the PROSPR consortium: a conceptual model for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening.;Abstract General frameworks of the cancer screening process are available, but none directly compare the process in detail across different organ sites. This limits the ability of medical and public health professionals to develop and evaluate coordinated screening programs that apply resources and population management strategies available for one cancer site to other sites. We present a trans-organ conceptual model that incorporates a single screening episode for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers into a unified framework based on clinical guidelines and protocols. the model concepts could be expanded to other organ sites. The model covers four types of care in the screening process: risk assessment, detection, diagnosis, and treatment. Interfaces between different provider teams (eg, primary care and specialty care), including communication and transfer of responsibility, may occur when transitioning between types of care. Our model highlights across each organ site similarities and differences in steps, interfaces, and transitions in the screening process and documents the conclusion of a screening episode. This model was developed within the National Cancer Institute-funded consortium Population-based Research Optimizing Screening through Personalized Regimens (PROSPR). PROSPR aims to optimize the screening process for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer and includes seven research centers and a statistical coordinating center. Given current health care reform initiatives in the United States, this conceptual model can facilitate the development of comprehensive quality metrics for cancer screening and promote trans-organ comparative cancer screening research.

Mammography facilities within the NBCCEDP gradually shifted from plain-film to digital mammography. The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of replacing film with digital mammography on health effects (deaths averted, life-years gained [LYG]). costs (for screening and diagnostics). and number of women reached. METHODS: NBCCEDP 2010 data and data representative of the program's target population were used in two established microsimulation models. Models simulated observed screening behavior including different screening intervals (annual, biennial, irregular) and starting ages (40, 50 years) for white, black, and Hispanic women. Model runs were performed in 2012. RESULTS: The models predicted 8.0-8.3 LYG per 1,000 film screens for black women, 5.9-7.5 for white women, and 4.0-4.5 for Hispanic women. For all race/ethnicity groups, digital mammography had more LYG than film mammography (2%-4%), but had higher costs (34%-35%). Assuming a fixed budget, 25%-26% fewer women could be served, resulting in 22%-24% fewer LYG if all mammograms were converted to digital. The loss in LYG could be reversed to an 8%-13% increase by only including biennial screening. CONCLUSIONS: Digital could result in slightly more LYG than film mammography. However, with a fixed budget, fewer women may be served with fewer LYG. Changes in the program, such as only including biennial screening, will increase LYG/screen and could offset the potential decrease in LYG when shifting to digital mammography.

No study has evaluated NBCCEDP's effect on breast cancer mortality. PURPOSE: This study estimates life-years saved by NBCCEDP breast cancer screening compared with screening in the absence of NBCCEDP and with no screening. METHODS: A breast cancer simulation model based on existing Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network models was constructed. The screening module from these models was modified to reflect screening frequency for NBCCEDP participants. Screening data for uninsured women represented what would have happened without the program. Separate simulations were performed for women who received NBCCEDP (Program) screening, women who potentially received screening without the program (No Program), and women who received no screening (No Screening). The impact of NBCCEDP was estimated as the difference in life-years between the Program and No Program, and the Program and No Screening scenarios. The analysis was performed in 2008-2009. RESULTS: Among 1.8 million women who were screened between 1991 and 2006, the Program saved 100,800 life-years compared with No Program and 369,000 life-years compared with No Screening. Per woman screened, the Program saved 0.056 life-years (95% CI=0.031, 0.081) compared with No Program and 0.206 life-years (95% CI=0.177, 0.234) compared with No Screening. Per woman with invasive breast cancer and screen-detected invasive cancer, the Program saved 0.41 and 0.71 life-years, respectively, compared with No Program. CONCLUSIONS: These estimates suggest that NBCCEDP breast cancer screening has reduced mortality among medically uninsured and underinsured low-income women.

An overdiagnosed case is an excess case detected by screening. Estimates of the frequency of overdiagnosis in breast and prostate cancer screening vary greatly across studies. This article identifies features of overdiagnosis studies that influence results and shows their effect by using published research. First, different ways to define and measure overdiagnosis are considered. Second, contextual features and how they affect overdiagnosis estimates are examined. Third, the effect of estimation approach is discussed. Many studies use excess incidence under screening as a proxy for overdiagnosis. Others use statistical models to make inferences about lead time or natural history and then derive the corresponding fraction of cases that are overdiagnosed. This article concludes with questions that readers of overdiagnosis studies can use to evaluate the validity and relevance of published estimates and recommends that authors of studies quantifying overdiagnosis provide information about these features.;Ann Intern Med. 2013 Jun 4.158(11):831-8. doi: 10.7326/0003-4819-158-11-201306040-00008.;Etzioni R1, Gulati R, Mallinger L, Mandelblatt J.;23732716;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.,Review,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology,Early Detection of Cancer*/methods,Humans,Incidence,Male,Mass Screening*/methods,Models, Statistical,Prostatic Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Prostatic Neoplasms/epidemiology,Research Design,U01 CA152958/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,U01CA088283/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,P01 CA154292/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,P01CA154292/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,K05 CA096940/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,U01CA157224/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,U01CA152958/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,K05CA96940/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,U01 CA088283/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,U01 CA157224/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;Breast Neoplasms, Prostatic Neoplasms, Early Detection of Cancer;;model valid;0.244"valid",The use of modeling to understand the impact of screening on U.S. mortality: examples from mammography and PSA testing.;Abstract Surveillance data represent a vital resource for understanding the impact of cancer control interventions on the population cancer burden. However, population cancer trends are a complex product of many factors, and estimating the contribution of any one of these factors can be challenging. Surveillance modeling is a technique for estimating the contribution of one or more interventions of interest to trends in disease incidence and mortality. In this article, we present several approaches to surveillance modeling of cancer screening interventions. We classify models as biological or epidemiological, depending on whether they model the full unobservable aspects of disease onset and progression, or models which reduce the complex process to simpler terms by summarizing portions of the disease process using mostly observed population level measures. We also describe differences between macrolevel models, microsimulation models and mechanistic models. We discuss procedures for model calibration and validation, and methods for presenting model results which are robust with respect to certain types of biased model estimates. As examples, we present several models of the impact of mammography screening on breast cancer mortality, and PSA screening on prostate cancer mortality. Both these examples are appropriate uses of surveillance modeling, even though for mammography there is extensive (although somewhat controversial) randomized trial evidence, whereas for PSA this biomarker has seen extensive use as a screening test prior to any controlled trial evidence of its efficacy. Some of the models presented here were developed as part of the National Cancer Institute's Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network.;Stat Methods Med Res. 2004 Dec.13(6):421-42.;Feuer EJ1, Etzioni R, Cronin KA, Mariotto A.;15587432;Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/mortality*,Female,Humans,Male,Mammography/utilization*,Models, Statistical*,Mortality/trends*,Population Surveillance,Prostate-Specific Antigen*,Prostatic Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Prostatic Neoplasms/mortality,United States/epidemiology,Prostate-Specific Antigen;Breast Neoplasms, Prostatic Neoplasms, Early Detection of Cancer;;model valid;0.264"valid",Screening for prostate, breast and colorectal cancer in renal transplant recipients.;Abstract American Society of Transplantation guidelines recommend screening renal transplant recipients for breast, colorectal and prostate cancer. However there is a lack of evidence to support this practice. Computer simulation modeling was used to estimate the years of life lost as a result of these cancers in 50-year-old renal transplant recipients and subjects in the general population. Renal transplant recipients lost fewer years of life to cancer than people in the general population largely because of reduced life expectancy. In nondiabetic transplant recipients, loss of life as a result of these cancers was comparable with that in the general population only under assumptions of increased cancer incidence and cancer-specific mortality risks. Even with two-fold higher cancer incidence and disease-specific mortality risks, diabetic transplant recipients lost considerably fewer life years to cancer than those in the general population. Recommended cancer screening for the general population may not yield the expected benefits in the average renal transplant recipient but the benefits will be considerably higher than for patients on dialysis. Transplanted patients at above-average cancer risk in good health may achieve the benefits of screening that are seen in the general population.;Am J Transplant. 2003 May.3(5):619-25.;Kiberd BA1, Keough-Ryan T, Clase CM.;12752319;Colorectal Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Computer Simulation,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Female,Guidelines as Topic,Humans,Kidney Transplantation/adverse effects*,Kidney Transplantation/standards,Male,Mass Screening/economics*,Mass Screening/methods,Prostatic Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Time Factors;Breast Neoplasms, Prostatic Neoplasms, Early Detection of Cancer;;model valid;0.376"valid",Assessing uncertainty in microsimulation modelling with application to cancer screening interventions.;Abstract Microsimulation is fast becoming the approach of choice for modelling and analysing complex processes in the absence of mathematical tractability. While this approach has been developed and promoted in engineering contexts for some time, it has more recently found a place in the mainstream of the study of chronic disease interventions such as cancer screening. The construction of a simulation model requires the specification of a model structure and sets of parameter values, both of which may have a considerable amount of uncertainty associated with them. This uncertainty is rarely quantified when reporting micro-simulation results. We suggest a Bayesian approach and assume a parametric probability distribution to mathematically express the uncertainty related to model parameters. First, we design a simulation experiment to achieve good coverage of the parameter space. Second, we model a response surface for the outcome of interest as a function of the model parameters using the simulation results. Third, we summarize the variability in the outcome of interest, including variation due to parameter uncertainty, using the response surface in combination with parameter probability distributions. We illustrate the proposed method with an application of a microsimulator designed to investigate the effect of prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening on prostate cancer mortality rates.;Stat Med. 1998 Nov 15.17(21):2509-23.;Cronin KA1, Legler JM, Etzioni RD.;9819842;Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.,Adult,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis,Breast Neoplasms/mortality,Female,Humans,Male,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical*,Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Neoplasms/mortality,Prostate-Specific Antigen/analysis,Prostatic Neoplasms/diagnosis,Prostatic Neoplasms/mortality,Prostate-Specific Antigen,N01-CN-05230/CN/NCI NIH HHS/United States;Breast Neoplasms, Prostatic Neoplasms, Early Detection of Cancer;;model valid;0.2"one",Risk Prediction Models for Lung Cancer: A Systematic Review.;Abstract Many lung cancer risk prediction models have been published but there has been no systematic review or comprehensive assessment of these models to assess how they could be used in screening. We performed a systematic review of lung cancer prediction models and identified 31 articles that related to 25 distinct models, of which 11 considered epidemiological factors only and did not require a clinical input. Another 11 articles focused on models that required a clinical assessment such as a blood test or scan, and 8 articles considered the 2-stage clonal expansion model. More of the epidemiological models had been externally validated than the more recent clinical assessment models. There was varying discrimination, the ability of a model to distinguish between cases and controls, with an area under the curve between 0.57 and 0.879 and calibration, the model's ability to assign an accurate probability to an individual. In our review we found that further validation studies need to be considered. especially for the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial 2012 Model Version (PLCOM2012) and Hoggart models, which recorded the best overall performance. Future studies will need to focus on prediction rules, such as optimal risk thresholds, for models for selective screening trials. Only 3 validation studies considered prediction rules when validating the models and overall the models were validated using varied tests in distinct populations, which made direct comparisons difficult. To improve this, multiple models need to be tested on the same data set with considerations for sensitivity, specificity, model accuracy, and positive predictive values at the optimal risk thresholds.;Clin Lung Cancer. 2016 Mar.17(2):95-106. doi: 10.1016/j.cllc.2015.11.007.

A decision tree model was built in the context of the new Dutch cervical cancer-screening program and includes a primary test for the presence of HPV. Based on data of cervical cancer screening and HPV prevalence in the Netherlands, cohorts were created with HPV-16 or 18 positive women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2 or 3 or cervical cancer stage 1A (FIGO 1A). In the base case, the vaccine price was based on equal numbers of effective treatments in the vaccine branch and the current treatments branch of the model, and parity in cost, i.e. total cost in both branches are the same. The vaccine price is calculated by subtracting the cost of the vaccine branch from cost in the standard treatment branch and divided by the total number of women in the cohort, thereby equalizing costs in both strategies. Scenario analyses were performed taking quality adjusted life years (QALYs) into account with �20,000/QALY, �50,000/QALY and �80,000/QALY as corresponding thresholds. Sensitivity analyses were specifically targeted at the characteristics of the type-specific HPV test in the screening practice and vaccine efficacy. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was performed to quantify the level of uncertainty of the results found in the base case. In the base case, break-even vaccine prices of �381, �568 and �1697 were found for CIN 2, CIN 3 and FIGO 1A, respectively. The PSA showed vaccine pricing below �310, �490 and �1660 will be cost saving with a likelihood of 95% for CIN 2, CIN 3 and FIGO 1A, respectively. The vaccine price proved to be very sensitive for inclusion of QALY gains, including the HPV-type specific test into the Dutch screening practice and vaccine efficacy.;Vaccine. 2016 Dec 7.34(50):6381-6387. doi: 10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.10.019.

MFX is the preferred choice in many developed countries. Evidence shows little difference in how effectively SFX and MFX reduce pain. However, SFX is associated with higher retreatment and (in one meta-analysis) pathological fracture rates. MFX is, however, more time-consuming and expensive. We estimated the cost-effectiveness of SFX versus MFX for metastatic bone pain in breast, prostate and lung cancer in New Zealand. METHODS: We constructed a Markov microsimulation model to estimate health gain (in quality-adjusted life-years or QALYs), health system costs (in real 2011 NZ dollars) and cost-effectiveness. The model was populated using effect estimates from randomized controlled trials and other studies, and New Zealand cancer and cost data. Disability weights from the 2010 Global Burden of Disease study were used in estimating QALYs. RESULTS: Across all three cancers, QALY gains were similar for SFX compared to MFX, and per patient costs were less for SFX than MFX, with a difference of NZ$1469 (95% uncertainty interval $1112 to $1886) for lung cancer, $1316 ($810 to $1854) for prostate cancer and $1344 ($855 to $1846) for breast cancer. Accordingly, from a cost-effectiveness perspective, SFX was the preferable treatment option. Various sensitivity analyses did not overturn the clear preference for SFX. CONCLUSION: For all three cancers, SFX was clearly more cost-effective than MFX. This adds to the case for desisting from offering MFX to patients with metastatic bone pain, from a cost-effectiveness angle. � 2016 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists.;J Med Imaging Radiat Oncol. 2016 Oct.60(5):650-660. doi: 10.1111/1754-9485.12467.

Our objective was to investigate the association between hospital medical care spending intensity and mortality rates in cancer patients. METHODS: A total of 80,597 patients with incident cancer diagnosed in 2002 were identified from the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan, Republic of China. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to compare the 5-year survival rates of patients treated at hospitals with different spending intensities after adjusting for possible confounding and risk factors. RESULTS: After adjustment for patient characteristics, treatment modality, and hospital volume, an association was found between lower hospital spending intensity and poorer survival rates. The 5-year survival rate expressed by hazard ratios was 1.36 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.30-1.43, p < .001) for colorectal cancer, 1.18 (95% CI: 1.08-1.29, p < .001) for lung cancer, 1.13 (95% CI: 1.05-1.22, p = .002) for hepatoma, 1.16 (95% CI: 1.07-1.26, p < .001) for breast cancer, and 1.23 (95% CI: 1.10-1.39, p = .001) for prostate cancer. CONCLUSION: Our preliminary findings indicate that higher hospital spending intensity was associated with lower mortality rates in patients being treated for lung cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, hepatoma, or head and neck cancer. The cancer stages were unavailable in this series, and more research linked with the primary data may be necessary to clearly address this issue. �AlphaMed Press.;Oncologist. 2014 Sep.19(9):990-8. doi: 10.1634/theoncologist.2014-0013.

A systematic review and critical appraisal of economic evaluations of radiotherapy for cancer.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Breast, cervical and colorectal cancers are the three most frequent cancers in women, while lung, prostate and colorectal cancers are the most frequent in men. Much attention has been given to the economic evaluation of pharmaceuticals for treatment of cancer by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the UK and similar authorities internationally, while economic analysis developed for other types of anti-cancer interventions, including radiotherapy and surgery, are less common. OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to review methods used in published cost-effectiveness studies evaluating radiotherapy for breast, cervical, colorectal, head and neck and prostate cancer, and to compare the economic evaluation methods applied with those defined in the guidelines used by the NICE technology appraisal programme. METHODS: A systematic search of seven databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CDSR, NHSEED, HTA, DARE, EconLit) as well as research registers, the NICE website and conference proceedings was conducted in July 2012. Only economic evaluations of radiotherapy interventions in individuals diagnosed with cancer that included quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) or life-years (LYs) were included. Included studies were appraised on the basis of satisfying essential, preferred and UK-specific methods requirements, building on the NICE Reference Case for economic evaluations and on other methods guidelines. RESULTS: A total of 29 studies satisfied the inclusion criteria (breast 14, colorectal 2, prostate 10, cervical 0, head and neck 3). Only two studies were conducted in the UK (13 in the USA). Among essential methods criteria, the main issue was that only three (10%) of the studies used clinical-effectiveness estimates identified through systematic review of the literature. Similarly, only eight (28%) studies sourced health-related quality-of-life data directly from patients with the condition of interest. Other essential criteria (e.g. clear description of comparators, patient group indication and appropriate time horizon) were generally fulfilled, while most of the UK-specific requirements were not met. CONCLUSION: Based on this review there is a dearth of up-to-date, robust evidence on the cost effectiveness of radiotherapy in cancer suitable to support decision making in the UK. Studies selected did not fully satisfy essential method standards currently recommended by NICE.;Appl Health Econ Health Policy. 2014 Oct.12(5):497-510. doi: 10.1007/s40258-014-0115-8.;Barbieri M1, Weatherly HL, Ara R, Basarir H, Sculpher M, Adams R, Ahmed H, Coles C, Guerrero-Urbano T, Nutting C, Powell M.;25060829;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Review,Advisory Committees,Breast Neoplasms/economics,Breast Neoplasms/radiotherapy,Colorectal Neoplasms/economics,Colorectal Neoplasms/radiotherapy,Cost-Benefit Analysis*,Decision Making,Evaluation Studies as Topic*,Female,Head and Neck Neoplasms/economics,Head and Neck Neoplasms/radiotherapy,Humans,Male,Models, Economic,Neoplasms/economics*,Neoplasms/radiotherapy*,Prostatic Neoplasms/economics,Prostatic Neoplasms/radiotherapy,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,Radiotherapy/economics*,United Kingdom,United States,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/economics,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/radiotherapy,G0701302/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom,G1002509/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom,Department of Health/United Kingdom; Combined Modality Therapy,Lung Neoplasms, Prostatic Neoplasms, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms,Breast Neoplasms, Lung Neoplasms;;model valid;0.516"not valid",The effect of rib and lung heterogeneities on the computed dose to lung in Ir-192 high-dose-rate breast brachytherapy: Monte Carlo versus a treatment planning system.;Abstract AIMS: This study investigates to what extent the dose received by lungs from a commercially available treatment planning system, Ir-192 high-dose-rate (HDR), in breast brachytherapy, is accurate, with the emphasis on tissue heterogeneities, and taking into account the presence of ribs, in dose delivery to the lung. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A computed tomography (CT) scan of a breast was acquired and transferred to the 3-D treatment planning system and was also used to construct a patient-equivalent phantom. An implant involving 13 plastic catheters and 383 programmed source dwell positions were simulated, using the Monte Carlo N-Particle eXtended (MCNPX) code. The Monte Carlo calculations were compared with the corresponding commercial treatment planning system (TPS) in the form of percentage isodose and cumulative dose-volume histogram (DVH) in the breast, lungs, and ribs. RESULTS: The comparison of the Monte Carlo results and the TPS calculations showed that a percentage of isodose greater than 75% in the breast, which was located rather close to the implant or away from the breast curvature surface and lung boundary, were in good agreement. TPS calculations overestimated the dose to the lung for lower isodose contours that were lying near the breast surface and the boundary of breast and lung and were relatively away from the implant. CONCLUSIONS: Taking into account the ribs and entering the actual data for breasts, ribs, and lungs, revealed an average overestimation of the dose by a factor of 8% in the lung for TPS calculations. Therefore, the accuracy of the TPS results may be limited to regions near the implants where the treatment is planned, and is a more conservative approach for regions at boundaries with curvatures or tissues with a different material than that in the breast.;J Cancer Res Ther. 2012 Jul-Sep.8(3):394-8. doi: 10.4103/0973-1482.103519.;Yazdi HS1, Shamsaei M, Jaberi R, Shabani HR, Allahverdi M, Vaezzadeh SA.;23174721;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Algorithms,Brachytherapy/methods*,Breast/radiation effects,Breast Neoplasms/radiotherapy*,Computer Simulation,Female,Humans,Iridium Radioisotopes/therapeutic use*,Lung/radiation effects,Models, Biological,Monte Carlo Method,Phantoms, Imaging,Radiotherapy Dosage*,Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted*,Ribs/radiation effects,Tomography Scanners, X-Ray Computed,Iridium Radioisotopes;Breast Neoplasms, Lung Neoplasms, Combined Modality Therapy;;model valid;0.172"not valid",Chemotherapy administration: modelling the costs of alternative protocols.;Abstract BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The increasing cost of chemotherapy is placing greater pressures on limited healthcare budgets. A potentially important, but often overlooked, aspect of chemotherapy is the cost associated with administration. This study aims to develop a better understanding of these costs, and in doing so, develop a model to estimate the comparative cost of administering alternative chemotherapy protocols for economic evaluation or local decision making. METHODS: We identified the potential tasks and choices related to administering intravenous chemotherapy, grouped tasks according to anticipated resource use, and allocated costs to each task using data from an evidence-based collection of cancer protocols or from primary data collection. The resources were costed from a healthcare system perspective using standard data sources within Australia. The model was applied to alternative protocols used in the treatment of three different cancers: locally advanced and metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer, adjuvant colorectal cancer and adjuvant breast cancer. RESULTS: For the three cancer types examined, the cost of completed administration ranged from 1274 Australian dollars ($A) to $A3015 (year 2009 values) for 13 different protocols potentially used for the initial treatment of locally advanced and metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer. $A5175-8445 for seven protocols for adjuvant colorectal cancer treatment. and $A1494-4074 for seven protocols for adjuvant breast cancer treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The results are of practical significance to those undertaking economic evaluations and to decision makers who use this information within the area of chemotherapy. The examples used suggest that administration costs per visit varied inversely with the number of visits. The results provide information where little has previously been available and may allow decisions about costs and resource allocation to be made with more certainty. Although our model uses costs from the public health system within an Australian state (New South Wales), it can be adapted for use in other jurisdictions.;Pharmacoeconomics. 2012 Dec 1.30(12):1173-86. doi: 10.2165/11597280-000000000-00000.;Haywood P1, de Raad J, van Gool K, Haas M, Gallego G, Pearson SA, Faedo M, Ward R.;23148697;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Administration, Intravenous,Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage,Antineoplastic Agents/economics,Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use*,Australia,Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy,Breast Neoplasms/economics,Breast Neoplasms/pathology,Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/drug therapy,Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/economics,Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/pathology,Chemotherapy, Adjuvant/economics,Chemotherapy, Adjuvant/methods,Colorectal Neoplasms/drug therapy,Colorectal Neoplasms/economics,Colorectal Neoplasms/pathology,Decision Making*,Drug Costs,Female,Humans,Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy,Lung Neoplasms/economics,Lung Neoplasms/pathology,Models, Economic*,Neoplasm Metastasis,New South Wales,Antineoplastic Agents,455366/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom;Breast Neoplasms, Lung Neoplasms, Combined Modality Therapy;;model valid;0.42"not valid",The effect of dose heterogeneity on radiation risk in medical imaging.;Abstract The current estimations of risk associated with medical imaging procedures rely on assessing the organ dose via direct measurements or simulation. The dose to each organ is assumed to be homogeneous. To take into account the differences in radiation sensitivities, the mean organ doses are weighted by a corresponding tissue-weighting coefficients provided by ICRP to calculate the effective dose, which has been used as a surrogate of radiation risk. However, those coefficients were derived under the assumption of a homogeneous dose distribution within each organ. That assumption is significantly violated in most medical-imaging procedures. In helical chest CT, for example, superficial organs (e.g. breasts) demonstrate a heterogeneous dose distribution, whereas organs on the peripheries of the irradiation field (e.g. liver) might possess a discontinuous dose profile. Projection radiography and mammography involve an even higher level of organ dose heterogeneity spanning up to two orders of magnitude. As such, mean dose or point measured dose values do not reflect the maximum energy deposited per unit volume of the organ. In this paper, the magnitude of the dose heterogeneity in both CT and projection X-ray imaging was reported, using Monte Carlo methods. The lung dose demonstrated factors of 1.7 and 2.2 difference between the mean and maximum dose for chest CT and radiography, respectively. The corresponding values for the liver were 1.9 and 3.5. For mammography and breast tomosynthesis, the difference between mean glandular dose and maximum glandular dose was 3.1. Risk models based on the mean dose were found to provide a reasonable reflection of cancer risk. However, for leukaemia, they were found to significantly under-represent the risk when the organ dose distribution is heterogeneous. A systematic study is needed to develop a risk model for heterogeneous dose distributions.;Radiat Prot Dosimetry. 2013 Jun.155(1):42-58. doi: 10.1093/rpd/ncs275.

METHODS: We used data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database for 306,709 persons aged 65 and older and diagnosed with breast, lung, colorectal, or prostate cancer between 1991 and 2002 to assess the number of patients assigned to initial cancer care, from 2 months before diagnosis to 12 months after diagnosis, and mean annual Medicare payments for this care according to cancer type and type of treatment. Mutually exclusive treatment categories were cancer-related surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and other hospitalizations during the period of initial cancer care. Linear regression models were used to assess temporal trends in the percentage of patients receiving treatment and costs for those treated. We extrapolated our results based on the SEER data to the US Medicare population to estimate national Medicare payments by cancer site and treatment category. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: For patients diagnosed in 2002, Medicare paid an average of $39,891 for initial care for each lung cancer patient, $41 134 for each colorectal cancer patient, and $20,964 for each breast cancer patient, corresponding to inflation-adjusted increases from 1991 of $7139, $5345, and $4189, respectively. During the same interval, the mean Medicare payment for initial care for prostate cancer declined by $196 to $18261 in 2002. Costs for any hospitalization accounted for the largest portion of payments for all cancers. Chemotherapy use increased markedly for all cancers between 1991 and 2002, as did radiation therapy use (except for colorectal cancers). Total 2002 Medicare payments for initial care for these four cancers exceeded $6.7 billion, with colorectal and lung cancers being the most costly overall. CONCLUSIONS: The statistically significant increase in costs of initial cancer treatment reflects more patients receiving surgery and adjuvant therapy and rising prices for these treatments. These trends are likely to continue in the near future, although more efficient targeting of costly therapies could mitigate the overall economic impact of this trend.;J Natl Cancer Inst. 2008 Jun 18.100(12):888-97. doi: 10.1093/jnci/djn175.

Models of the costs of diagnosis and treatment of lung and breast cancer were developed and incorporated into POHEM. Then, POHEM was used to evaluate the economic impact of chemotherapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer. reduced length of hospital stay following breast cancer surgery. and the provision of preventive tamoxifen to women at high risk of breast cancer. A lung cancer chemotherapy treatment decision framework was developed to rank order currently available chemotherapy regimens according to relative cost-effectiveness and cost-utility. Reducing post-surgical breast cancer hospitalisation with optimal home care support could produce major healthcare savings. However, the provision of preventive tamoxifen was estimated to have no population health benefit. This paper demonstrates that POHEM is an effective tool for performing economic evaluations of cancer control interventions and to inform healthcare policy decisions.;Eur J Cancer. 2001 Sep.37(14):1797-804.;Will BP1, Berthelot JM, Nobrega KM, Flanagan W, Evans WK.;11549434;Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/economics,Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use,Breast Neoplasms/economics*,Breast Neoplasms/therapy,Canada,Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/economics*,Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/therapy,Cost of Illness,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Female,Health Care Costs,Humans,Length of Stay,Lung Neoplasms/economics*,Lung Neoplasms/therapy,Models, Econometric*,Monte Carlo Method,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,Tamoxifen/therapeutic use,Treatment Outcome,Tamoxifen;Breast Neoplasms, Lung Neoplasms, Combined Modality Therapy;;model valid;0.48"not valid",Cost-effectiveness analysis of neoadjuvant pertuzumab and trastuzumab therapy for locally advanced, inflammatory, or early HER2-positive breast cancer in Canada.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: The NeoSphere trial demonstrated that the addition of pertuzumab to trastuzumab and docetaxel for the neoadjuvant treatment of HER2-positive locally advanced, inflammatory, or early breast cancer (eBC) resulted in a significant improvement in pathological complete response (pCR). Furthermore, the TRYPHAENA trial supported the benefit of neoadjuvant dual anti-HER2 therapy. Survival data from these trials is not yet available. however, other studies have demonstrated a correlation between pCR and improved event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) in this patient population. This study represents the first Canadian cost-effectiveness analysis of pertuzumab in the neoadjuvant treatment of HER2-positive eBC. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis (CUA) was conducted using a three health state Markov model ('event-free', 'relapsed', and 'dead'). Two separate analyses were conducted. the first considering total pCR (ypT0/is ypN0) data from NeoSphere, and the second from TRYPHAENA. Published EFS and OS data partitioned for patients achieving/not achieving pCR were used in combination with the percentage achieving pCR in the pertuzumab trials to estimate survival. This CUA included published utility values and direct medical costs including drugs, treatment administration, management of adverse events, supportive care, and subsequent therapy. To address uncertainty, a probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) and alternative scenarios were explored. RESULTS: Both analyses suggested that the addition of pertuzumab resulted in increased life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The incremental cost per QALY ranged from $25,388 (CAD. NeoSphere analysis) to $46,196 (TRYPHAENA analysis). Sensitivity analyses further support the use of pertuzumab, with cost-effectiveness ratios ranging from $9230-$64,421. At a threshold of $100,000, the addition of pertuzumab was cost-effective in nearly all scenarios (93% NeoSphere. 79% TRYPHAENA). CONCLUSION: Given the improvement in clinical efficacy and a favorable cost per QALY, the addition of pertuzumab in the neoadjuvant setting represents an attractive treatment option for HER2-positive eBC patients.;J Med Econ. 2015 Mar.18(3):173-88. doi: 10.3111/13696998.2014.979938.

METHODS: The planning system (called CARMEN) is a full MC-TPS, controlled through aMATLAB interface, which is based on the sequencing of a novel map, called ""biophysical"" map, which is generated from enhanced image data of patients to achieve a set of segments actually deliverable. In order to reduce the required computation time, the conventional fluence map has been replaced by the biophysical map which is sequenced to provide direct apertures that will later be weighted by means of an optimization algorithm based on linear programming. A ray-casting algorithm throughout the patient CT assembles information about the found structures, the mass thickness crossed, as well as PET values. Data are recorded to generate a biophysical map for each gantry angle. These maps are the input files for a home-made sequencer developed to take into account the interactions of photons and electrons with the MLC. For each linac (Axesse of Elekta and Primus of Siemens) and energy beam studied (6, 9, 12, 15 MeV and 6 MV), phase space files were simulated with the EGSnrc/BEAMnrc code. The dose calculation in patient was carried out with the BEAMDOSE code. This code is a modified version of EGSnrc/DOSXYZnrc able to calculate the beamlet dose in order to combine them with different weights during the optimization process. RESULTS: Three complex radiotherapy treatments were selected to check the reliability of CARMEN in situations where the MC calculation can offer an added value: A head-and-neck case (Case I) with three targets delineated on PET/CT images and a demanding dose-escalation. a partial breast irradiation case (Case II) solved with photon and electron modulated beams (IMRT + MERT). and a prostatic bed case (Case III) with a pronounced concave-shaped PTV by using volumetric modulated arc therapy. In the three cases, the required target prescription doses and constraints on organs at risk were fulfilled in a short enough time to allow routine clinical implementation. The quality assurance protocol followed to check CARMEN system showed a high agreement with the experimental measurements. CONCLUSIONS: A Monte Carlo treatment planning model exclusively based on maps performed from patient imaging data has been presented. The sequencing of these maps allows obtaining deliverable apertures which are weighted for modulation under a linear programming formulation.

External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) is a mainstay of treatment for patients with bone metastases. However, the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of EBRT in patients with bone metastases have not been adequately understood. The current work aims at reviewing recent cost-effectiveness literature of EBRT on patients with bone metastases. RECENT FINDINGS: Studies have consistently shown that EBRT is associated with significant pain relief, and existing cost-effectiveness studies have suggested that single fraction radiation therapy is more cost effective than multiple fraction radiation therapy in pain palliation. However, due to the high dependence of the data among these studies and the absence of significant amount of information, the current findings may require supports from further research in validating the results. SUMMARY: This work sheds the light on future economic models in applying individual preference to survey questionnaires, such as, contingent valuation/conjoint choice, to carefully measure utility improvements from a treatment. In addition, research with focus on patient-centered outcome is encouraged to help clinician better understand patients' perceived outcomes of EBRT.;Curr Opin Support Palliat Care. 2013 Sep.7(3):278-83. doi: 10.1097/SPC.0b013e328362e8e3.;Cai B1, Nickman NA, Gaffney DK.;23912387;Review,Bone Neoplasms/radiotherapy*,Bone Neoplasms/secondary,Breast Neoplasms/pathology,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Female,Humans,Male,Models, Economic,Prostatic Neoplasms/pathology,Quality of Life,Radiotherapy/economics*,Radiotherapy/methods*;Breast Neoplasms, Prostatic Neoplasms, Combined Modality Therapy;;model valid;0.264"not valid",The Malthus Programme: developing radiotherapy demand models for breast and prostate cancer at the local, regional and national level.;Abstract AIMS: The Malthus Programme has delivered a tool for modelling radiotherapy demand in England. The model is capable of simulating demand at the local level. This article investigates the local and regional level variation in predicted demand with respect to Breast and Prostate cancer, the two tumour types responsible for the majority of radiotherapy treatment workload in England. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Simulations were performed using the Malthus model, using base population incidence data for the period from 2007-2009. Simulations were carried out at the level of Primary Care Trusts, Cancer Networks, and nationwide, with annual projections for 2012, 2016 and 2020. Benchmarking was undertaken against previously published models from the UK, Canada and Australia. RESULTS: For breast cancer, the fraction burden for 2012 varied from 5537 fractions per million in Tower Hamlets PCT to 18 896 fractions per million in Devon PCT (national mean - 13 592 fractions per million). For prostate cancer, the fraction burden for 2012 varied from 4874 fractions per million in Tower Hamlets PCT to 23 181 fractions per million in Lincolnshire PCT (national mean - 15 087 fractions per million). Predictions of population growth by age cohort for 2016 and 2020 result in the regional differences in radiotherapy demand becoming greater over time. Similar effects were also observed at the level of the cancer network. CONCLUSIONS: Our model shows the importance of local population demographics and cancer incidence rates when commissioning radiotherapy services. Copyright � 2013 The Royal College of Radiologists.

The effect of the tissue composition was investigated because the breast localization presents heterogeneities such as glandular and adipose tissue surrounded by air, lungs, and ribs. The absolute MC dose calculations were benchmarked by comparison to the absolute dose obtained from experimental results. Before modeling a clinical case of an implant in heterogeneous breast, the effects of the tissue composition and the interseed attenuation were studied in homogeneous phantoms. To investigate the tissue composition effect, the dose along the transverse axis of the two seed models were calculated and compared in different materials. For each seed model, three seeds sharing the same transverse axis were simulated to evaluate the interseed effect in water as a function of the distance from the seed. A clinical study of a permanent breast 125I implant for a single patient was carried out using four dose calculation techniques: (1) A TG-43 based calculation, (2) a full MC simulation with realistic tissues and seed models, (3) a MC simulation in water and modeled seeds, and (4) a MC simulation without modeling the seed geometry but with realistic tissues. In the latter, a phase space file corresponding to the particles emitted from the external surface of the seed is used at each seed location. The results were compared by calculating the relevant clinical metrics V85, V100, and V200 for this kind of treatment in the target. D90 and D50 were also determined to evaluate the differences in dose and compare the results to the studies published for permanent prostate seed implants in literature. The experimental results are in agreement with the MC absolute doses (within 5% for EBT Gafchromic film and within 7% for TLD-100). Important differences between the dose along the transverse axis of the seed in water and in adipose tissue are obtained (10% at 3.5 cm). The comparisons between the full MC and the TG-43 calculations show that there are no significant differences for V85 and V100. For V200, 8.4% difference is found coming mainly from the tissue composition effect. Larger differences (about 10.5% for the model 6711 seed and about 13% for the InterSource125) are determined for D90 and D50. These differences depend on the composition of the breast tissue modeled in the simulation. A variation in percentage by mass of the mammary gland and adipose tissue can cause important differences in the clinical dose metrics V200, D90, and D50. Even if the authors can conclude that clinically, the differences in V85, V100, and V200 are acceptable in comparison to the large variation in dose in the treated volume, this work demonstrates that the development of a MC treatment planning system for LDR brachytherapy will improve the dose determination in the treated region and consequently the dose-outcome relationship, especially for the skin toxicity.;Med Phys. 2009 May.36(5):1848-58.;Furstoss C1, Reniers B, Bertrand MJ, Poon E, Carrier JF, Keller BM, Pignol JP, Beaulieu L, Verhaegen F.;19544804;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Brachytherapy/instrumentation*,Brachytherapy/methods,Breast Implants*,Breast Neoplasms/radiotherapy*,Computer Simulation,Computer-Aided Design,Equipment Design,Equipment Failure Analysis,Female,Humans,Models, Biological*,Monte Carlo Method,Radiometry/methods*,Radiotherapy Dosage,Reproducibility of Results,Sensitivity and Specificity;Breast Neoplasms, Prostatic Neoplasms, Combined Modality Therapy;;model valid;0.172"not valid",Biological-based optimization and volumetric modulated arc therapy delivery for stereotactic body radiation therapy.;Abstract PURPOSE: To describe biological-based optimization and Monte Carlo (MC) dose calculation-based treatment planning for volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) delivery of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in lung, liver, and prostate patients. METHODS: Optimization strategies and VMAT planning parameters using a biological-based optimization MC planning system were analyzed for 24 SBRT patients. Patients received a median dose of 45 Gy [range, 34-54 Gy] for lung tumors in 1-5 fxs and a median dose of 52 Gy [range, 48-60 Gy] for liver tumors in 3-6 fxs. Prostate patients received a fractional dose of 10 Gy in 5 fxs. Biological-cost functions were used for plan optimization, and its dosimetric quality was evaluated using the conformity index (CI), the conformation number (CN), the ratio of the volume receiving 50% of the prescription dose over the planning target volume (Rx/PTV50). The quality and efficiency of the delivery were assessed according to measured quality assurance (QA) passing rates and delivery times. For each disease site, one patient was replanned using physical cost function and compared to the corresponding biological plan. RESULTS: Median CI, CN, and Rx/PTV50 for all 24 patients were 1.13 (1.02-1.28), 0.79 (0.70-0.88), and 5.3 (3.1-10.8), respectively. The median delivery rate for all patients was 410 MU/min with a maximum possible rate of 480 MU/min (85%). Median QA passing rate was 96.7%, and it did not significantly vary with the tumor site. CONCLUSIONS: VMAT delivery of SBRT plans optimized using biological-motivated cost-functions result in highly conformal dose distributions. Plans offer shorter treatment-time benefits and provide efficient dose delivery without compromising the plan conformity for tumors in the prostate, lung, and liver, thereby improving patient comfort and clinical throughput. The short delivery times minimize the risk of patient setup and intrafraction motion errors often associated with long SBRT treatment delivery times.;Med Phys. 2012 Jan.39(1):237-45. doi: 10.1118/1.3668059.;Diot Q1, Kavanagh B, Timmerman R, Miften M.;22225293;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.,Computer Simulation,Humans,Models, Biological*,Neoplasms/surgery*,Quality Control,Radiometry/methods*,Radiosurgery/methods*,Radiotherapy Dosage,Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted/methods*,Reproducibility of Results,Sensitivity and Specificity,Software*;Lung Neoplasms, Prostatic Neoplasms, Combined Modality Therapy;;model valid;0.188

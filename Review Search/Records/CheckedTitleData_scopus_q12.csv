However, evaluation on spatial and temporal scales is needed to assess the efficacy of this program in smaller regions. Here, we geographically assess incidence in a province with a uniquely heterogeneous distribution of lifestyle factors associated with religiosity. Methods: Cervical cancer cases were extracted from the provincial cancer registry from 1989 to 2013. Age-adjusted incidence rates were calculated using population statistics from the census bureau and adjusted to the Segi world standard population. Bayesian hierarchical modelling was employed to spatiotemporally map cervical cancer incidence trends in Songkhla province in 5-year period. Results: Overall, the incidence of cervical cancer decreased in Songkhla province. The three districts with a Muslim population of greater than 70% had consistently lower cervical cancer rates from 1989 to 2013 compared with the rest of the predominantly Buddhist districts. Hotspots of incidence were identified in Sadao, Hat Yai and the juncture ofMueang Songkhla and Singhanakhon in each 5-year period. Conclusions: Distinct cervical cancer incidence trends by religion over time indicate differences in sexual habits, lifestyle and religion-associated culture between Muslims and Buddhists, and suggest divergent risk factor profiles for these groups. The high incidence rates in Sadao and Hat Yai is likely explained by the main road to Malaysia, which runs across these two areas and has frequent commercial sex trade. Female sex workers should be targeted as a vulnerable population for screening efforts to address this continuing burden of cervical cancer. © The Author 2016.;Cancer, Cervical screening, Mapping, Prevention, Thailand, Vulnerable populations;;;;;;

Incidence and mortality rates have demonstrated notable changes in Asian and African countries during the last few decades. In this study, we first aimed to determine the trend of colorectal cancer mortality rate in each Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) region, and then re-classify them to find more homogenous classes. Materials and Methods: Our study population consisted of 52 countries of Asia and North Africa in six IHME pre-defined regions for both genders and age-standardized groups from 1990 to 2010.We first applied simple growth models for pre-defined IHME regions to estimate the intercepts and slopes of mortality rate trends. Then, we clustered the 52 described countries using the latent growth mixture modeling approach for classifying them based on their colorectal mortality rates over time. Results: Statistical analysis revealed that males and people in high income Asia pacific and East Asia countries were at greater risk of death from colon and rectum cancer. In addition, South Asia region had the lowest rates of mortality due to this cancer. Simple growth modeling showed that majority of IHME regions had decreasing trend in mortality rate of colorectal cancer. However, re-classification these countries based on their mortality trend using the latent growth mixture model resulted in more homogeneous classes according to colorectal mortality trend. Conclusions: In general, our statistical analyses showed that most Asian and North African countries had upward trend in their colorectal cancer mortality. We therefore urge the health policy makers in these countries to evaluate the causes of growing mortality and study the interventional programs of successful countries in managing the consequences of this cancer.;Asia and North Africa, Colorectal cancer, Growth mixture model, Mortality rate;;;;;;

A saturated version of the model allows covariates having effects through all the parameters of survival time distribution. Accelerated failure-time models assume that only one parameter of the distribution depends on the covariates. Methods: We fitted both the conventional GG model and the saturated form for each of its members including the Weibull and lognormal distribution, and compared them using likelihood ratios. To compare the selected parameter distribution with log logistic distribution which is a famous distribution in survival analysis that is not included in generalized gamma family, we used the Akaike information criterion (AIC, r=l(b)-2p). All models were fitted using data for 369 women age 50 years or more, diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer in BC during 1990-1999 and followed to 2010.

We apply functional time series models on age-specific breast cancer mortality rates for each group of women, and forecast their mortality curves using exponential smoothing state-space models with damping. Materials and Methods: The data were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program of the US [1]. Mortality data were obtained from the National Centre for Health Statistics (NCHS) available on the SEER*Stat database. We use annual unadjusted breast cancer mortality rates from 1969 to 2004 in 5-year age groups (45-49, 50-54, 55-59, 60-64, 65-69, 70-74, 75-79, 80-84). Age-specific mortality curves were obtained using nonparametric smoothing methods. The curves are then decomposed using functional principal components and we fit functional time series models with four basis functions for each population separately. The curves from each population are forecast and prediction intervals are calculated. Results: Twenty-year forecasts indicate an overall decline in future breast cancer mortality rates for both groups of women. This decline appears to be steeper among white women aged 55-73 and black women aged 60-84. For black women under 55 years of age, the forecast rates are relatively stable indicating there is no significant change in future breast cancer mortality rates among young black women in the next 20 years. Conclusion: White women have smooth and consistent patterns in breast cancer mortality rates for all age-groups whereas the mortality rates for black women are much more variable. The projections suggest, for some age groups, black American women may not benefit equally from the overall decline in breast cancer mortality in the United States. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.;Breast cancer mortality, Forecasting, Functional data analysis, Racial and ethnic disparities, Screening, Trends;;;;;;

However, lack of biological plausibility and ease of interpretability on temporal components especially for age effects are generally the weakness of AAPC models. We develop a Bayesian AAPC model where carcinogenesis age effect is incorporated to explain age effects from the underlying disease process. An autoregressive prior structure and an arbitrary linear constraint are used to solve the nonidentifiability issues. Methods: Two multistage carcinogenesis models are employed to derive the hazard functions to substitute the age effects in the AAPC models. The Iowa county-wide lung cancer mortality data are used for the model fitting and Deviance Information Criteria (DIC) is used for model comparison. Results: Our study shows that conventional AAPC model (DIC = 19,231.30), AAPC model with Armitage-Doll age effect (DIC = 19,233.00) and with two-stage clonal expansion (TSCE) age effect (DIC = 19,234.70) achieved the similar DIC values which indicated consistent model fitting among three models. The spatial pattern shows that the high spatial effects are clustered in the south of Iowa and also in largely populated areas. The lung cancer mortality rate is continuously declining by birth cohorts while increasing by the calendar period until 2000-2004. The age effects show an increasing pattern over time which can be easily explained by Armitage-Doll carcinogenesis model since we assume a log-linear relationship between age and hazard function. Conclusions: Our finding suggests that the proposed Bayesian AAPC model can be used to replace the conventional AAPC model without affecting model performance while providing a more biological sound approach from the underlining disease process. © 2013.;AAPC, Bayesian, Nonidentifiability, Prior, Spatial, Temporal;;;;;;

This study estimates the chance that an untreated PSA-R would not progress to clinical metastasis within the patient's lifetime, that is, that recurrence is overdetected. Experimental Design: Times from PSA-R to metastasis were estimated from patients with RP treated at Johns Hopkins University (Baltimore, MD)who did not receive salvage treatment (n = 441) at PSA-R. Times to other-cause death were based on U.S. life tables adjusted to reflect other-cause survival among RP cases in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry. We used competing risks simulation to estimate lower bounds on the chance that other-cause death would precede clinical metastasis for patients with disease characteristics at diagnosis based on the Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor (CaPSURE) database ( n = 4,455). Results: Cumulative incidence of PSA-R in CaPSURE was 13.6% at 5 years and 19.9% at 10 years. The risk of other-cause death among patients with RP in SEER was 60% lower than the age-matched U.S. population. At least 9.1% of patients with PSA-R <5 years after RP and at least 15.6% of patients with PSA-R 5 to 10 years after RP were overdetected. At least 31.4% of patients over the age of 70 years at diagnosis, who recurred <10 years of diagnosis, were overdetected. Conclusions: This analysis indicates that PSA-R after RP may be overdetected, with risk depending on patient age and tumor characteristics.

Incidence rates under the status quo of opportunistic screening were projected by an age-period-cohort model, using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. Modelled rates were translated into numbers of cancer cases and deaths using mid-year population figures and age-period-specific mortality to incidence ratios. We applied International Agency for Research on Cancer risk reduction estimates for different screening strategies to these base case figures to estimate the number of incident cancers potentially averted and years of life saved attributable to organised screening incremental to the current status quo.

Estimation of future trends is important for public health planning. On the basis of the recent breast cancer incidence trends, we projected future disease rates in the rapidly transitioning Chinese population of Hong Kong. We used local data on breast cancer incidence and mid-year population figures for the years 1974-2003. We fitted Poisson age-period-cohort models with autoregressive priors on the age, period and cohort effects, and used projections of these effects to forecast future incidence to 2018. We found that age-standardized breast cancer incidence would continue to rise by ?1.1% per annum over the next 15 years, from 45.9 cases in 1999-2003 to 54.3 per 100,000 (95% credible interval: 50.9, 58.4) in 2014-2018. Recent secular incidence increases can be attributed to both ageing and intergenerational effects beginning with the postwar baby boomers, whereas there is no evidence for important changes by time period. There does not appear to be differential cohort-related risk for pre- vs. postmenopausal disease. Unlike most other cancers, breast cancer risk in local women would continue to increase in the short to medium term, at a similar rate of increase compared with historical trends. This could most likely be attributed to Hong Kong's socioeconomic developmental history and continuing adoption of westernized lifestyle changes. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.;Breast cancer, Chinese, Determinants, Incidence, Projection;;;;;;

It seems necessary to asses in details different screening programs aaccording to their influence on mortality and also its economy questions. Method: For assesment of different colorectal cancer screening programs a Markov's computer model was constructed. This model asesses their influence on mortality and joined financial expenses. The methods of screening in our model are: »one colonoscopy during the life«, and two colonoscopies (in 50 and 60 years of life) and fecal occult test. Results: This model was considered to 100 000 persons population would be involved into screening programs started in 50 years of age and followed-up to 85 years of age. If no program was not used then, according to that model, 100% (11 337 persons) would died. If one colonoscopy during the life (in 50 years of age) is done, then mortality would decreased to 66% (7335 persons), if two colonoscopies in the whole life would be done (the first in 50 and second in 60 years of age) than the highest decrease of mortality would be supposed to 57% (6521 persons). The highest number of polypectomies appeared in two colonoscopies during the life. Economically most expensive is the program of two colonoscopies during the life but the mortality rate decrease is highest. The least expensive is the only one colonoscopy during the life. Conclusion: In our flexible model for assessment of different screening programs for the discussed population the model of two colonoscopies after ten years is most effective to mortality rate but economically less favourable than one colonoscopy in the life or occult blood testing.

The calculations incorporate many assumptions, some of them more firmly based than others, such as uniformity of incidence trend in all the Nordic countries and also concerning the causality of various relations. For lack of evaluated Nordic data, we have used American figures concerning stage distributions and stage-specific relative survival rates.

BN is graphically represented using bioinformatics variables and can be used to support an informative medical decision/observation by using probabilistic reasoning. In this study, we propose such a BN to describe and predict the occurrence of brain metastasis from lung cancer. A nationwide database containing more than 50,000 cases of cancer patients from 1996 to 2010 in Taiwan was used in this study. The BN topology for studying brain metastasis from lung cancer was rigorously examined by domain experts/doctors. We used three statistical measures, namely, the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, to evaluate the performances of the proposed BN model and to compare it with three competitive approaches, namely, naive Bayes (NB), logistic regression (LR) and support vector machine (SVM). Experimental results show that no significant differences are observed in accuracy or specificity among the four models, while the proposed BN outperforms the others in terms of sampled average sensitivity. Moreover the proposed BN has advantages compared with the other approaches in interpreting how brain metastasis develops from lung cancer. It is shown to be easily understood by physicians, to be efficient in modeling non-linear situations, capable of solving stochastic medical problems, and handling situations wherein information are missing in the context of the occurrence of brain metastasis from lung cancer. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.;Bayesian network, Brain metastasis, Lung cancer;;;;;;

Methods: We performed a population-based, retrospective cohort study of men treated for nonmetastatic prostate cancer in Ontario, Canada, from 2002 to 2009. Patients treated with surgery and radiotherapy were matched on demographics, comorbidity, and cardiovascular risk factors. The primary outcome was non–prostate cancer mortality. Outcomes were compared using the Fine and Gray subdistribution method with generalized estimating equations. We used a previously published technique to quantify the prevalence and strength of residual confounding necessary to account for observed results. Results: We examined 5393 pairs of matched men. The 10-year cumulative incidence of non–prostate cancer mortality was higher among patients who underwent radiotherapy (12%) than surgery (8%, adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio [HR] 1.57, 95% confidence interval 1.35-1.83). Patients treated with radiotherapy also had an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality (adjusted HR 1.74, 95% confidence interval 1.27-2.37). Hypothetical residual confounders would have to be both strongly associated with non–prostate cancer mortality (HRs > 2.5) and have highly differential prevalence to nullify the observed effect. Conclusion: Among patients carefully matched on cardiovascular risk factors, those treated with radiotherapy had an increased risk of non–prostate cancer mortality and cardiovascular disease.

Evidence of several factors that identify patients at risk for complications from thoracotomy is controversial. The aim of this study was to introduce and implement in medical practice a fuzzy system used in risk assessment of pulmonary resection for lung cancer. Methods: Ninety-one consecutive patients who underwent pulmonary resection for lung cancer were investigated. The overall complication rate was 39.6% (a total of 63 complications were seen in 36 patients). A fuzzy logic model was created with 9 input (presence of chest pain, weight loss, clinical T stage of the tumor, FEV1, serum protein, preoperative arterial partial oxygen pressure and cigarette smoking, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and peripheral blood leukocyte count) and two output classes (high-risk and low-risk groups). The fuzzy classifier's performance was tested. Results: The model was able to predict correctly the occurrence of complications in 22 out of 29 patients in the high-risk group with a sensitivity of 76%, while 9 out of the 52 patients from the low-risk group developed complications (17%). Conclusion: The fuzzy classification system provides an accurate tool to predict complications of resections in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG.;Complication, Fuzzy logic, Lung cancer, Morbidity, Surgical resection;;;;;;

Along with being a major contributor to lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cerebrovascular disease, smoking is one of several modifiable risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD). The Coronary Heart Disease Policy Model is a computer simulation model of CAD in the United States. Using the model, one can project CAD incidence, prevalence, events, mortality, cost, cost-effectiveness, and gains in life expectancy from various risk factor modifications, including smoking interventions. The model projects that reducing the number of cigarettes smoked by 50% would increase the population-wide life expectancy of 35-year-old U.S. citizens by 0.4 year. Eliminating smoking would yield population-wide gains of 0.8 year for 35-year-old males and 0.7 year for 35-year-old females. These gains are comparable to those achieved with strict control of cholesterol levels, diastolic blood pressure, or weight. Gains for the smokers themselves would be much greater. On average, 35-year-old male smokers would live 1.2 years longer if they reduced the number of cigarettes smoked by 50%, and 2.3 years longer if they quit smoking. Females 35 years of age would live 1.5 years longer by cutting back by 50% and 2.8 years longer by quitting. These gains are equal to or greater than gains that individuals would realize by reducing serum cholesterol levels of 240-299 mg/dL to 200 mg/dL, controlling mild hypertension, or reducing weight from ?130% ideal body weight to ideal body weight. Gains projected by the Coronary Heart Disease Policy Model are comparable to those forecast by others, who have projected that young adults would gain approximately 0.2-8.7 years by quitting smoking, depending on their smoking history. Two studies have examined the cost-effectiveness of smoking interventions. One found that counseling smokers to quit would cost only $705-988 per year of life saved for males and $1,204-2,058 per year of life saved for females. The second study found that prescribing nicotine gum as an adjunct to counseling would cost only $4,113-6,465 per year of life saved for males and $6,880-9,473 per year of life saved for females. These cost-effectiveness ratios are more favorable than those of most other current healthcare interventions. Smoking cessation would increase population-wide life expectancy by about a year and the life expectancy of a smoker by several years. Simple interventions on the part of physicians to get smokers to quit are among the most cost-effective uses of healthcare resources. © 1992.;,adult, aged, coronary artery disease, cost benefit analysis, economics, female, forecasting, human, life expectancy, male, middle aged, mortality, review, smoking, smoking cessation, Adult, Aged, Coronary Disease, Cost-Benefit Analysis, Female, Forecasting, Humans, Life Expectancy, Male, Middle Aged, Smoking, Smoking Cessation;;;;;;

Methods: the study included cases and controls that were paired by sex and ± 10 years of age at diagnosis. In relation to cases, 46 patients with a confirmed histopathological diagnosis of adenocarcinoma-type GC, as reported in the hospital records, were selected, and 46 blood bank donors from the same hospital were included as controls. The previously validated Questionnaire to Find Factors Associated with Gastric Cancer (QUFA-GC©) was used to collect data. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (IC) were estimated via univariate analysis (paired OR). Multivariate analysis was performed by logistic regression. A decision tree was constructed using the J48 algorithm. Results: an association was found by univariate analysis between GC risk and a lack of formal education, having smoked for ? 10 years, eating rapidly, consuming very hot food and drinks, a non-suitable breakfast within two hours of waking, pickled food and capsaicin. In contrast, a protective association against GC was found with taking recreational exercise and consuming fresh fruit and vegetables. No association was found between the development of GC and having an income that reflected poverty, using a refrigerator, perception of the omission of breakfast and time period of alcoholism. In the final multivariate analysis model, having no formal education (OR = 17.47, 95% CI = 5.17-76.69), consuming a non-suitable breakfast within two hours of waking (OR = 8.99, 95% CI = 2.85-35.50) and the consumption of capsaicin ? 29.9 mg capsaicin per day (OR = 3.77, 95% CI = 1.21-13.11) were factors associated with GC. Conclusions: an association was found by multivariate analysis between the presence of GC and education, type of breakfast and the consumption of capsaicin.

We compared administration of the new 10-valent pneumococcal Haemophilus influenzae-protein D conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV) with no vaccination in two countries, the United Kingdom (UK) and Mexico, using two modelling strategies: a cohort model and a population model. The cohort model followed a birth cohort over a lifetime, beginning 10 years after initiation of the vaccine program, when vaccine efficacy steady state had been reached. The population model examined the country-specific population over 1 year, also beginning 10 years after initiation of the vaccine program. Both models included the same age-specific disease rates of meningitis, bacteraemia, pneumonia, and otitis media. The output variables were the numbers of specific events, with and without indirect vaccine effects. Without indirect effects, the cohort and population models produced similar results for both countries (deviation of <20% difference per output measure for most outcomes). The difference between the model types was much greater when indirect vaccine effects were included, especially in Mexico (up to 120% difference). Cohort and population modelling methods produce different results depending on the disease, the intervention, the demographic composition, and the time horizon evaluated.

To analyze the frequency of reporting a recently conducted mammogram and/or pap smear and follow-up of abnormal findings among rural poor women in Mexico. Methods. We performed a cross-sectional analysis using data collected in the ENCEL 2007-Oportunidades survey carried out between July - November, 2007. We used multilevel logistic regression to model the use of mammography and pap smears. Results. We found a low frequency of reported recent mammogram among the rural poor from 30-39 years old (12%) and 40-49 years old (16%) and a low frequency of reported medical follow-up of abnormal findings (60%), particularly among women at higher risk because of age or abnormal findings. These findings were associated with a lack of availability of medical resources and being of indigenous origin. Conclusion. It is fundamental to strengthen both access to and follow-up of mammography and papsmears, particularly among high-risk rural women in order to reduce the level of mortality associated with breast and cervical-uterine cancer.;Breast cancer, Cervical-uterine cancer, Mammography, Mexico, Pap, Rural areas;;;;;;

Data Sources/Study Setting Cost-effectiveness analysis. Study Design A Markov model to capture the disease progression of lung cancer and characterize clinical benefits of PN services as timeliness of treatment and care coordination. Taking a payer's perspective, we estimated the lifetime costs, life years (LYs), and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and addressed uncertainties in one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Data Collection/Extraction Methods Model inputs were extracted from the literature, supplemented with data from a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services demonstration project. Principal Findings Compared to usual care, PN services incurred higher costs but also yielded better outcomes. The incremental cost and effectiveness was $9,145 and 0.47 QALYs, respectively, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $19,312/QALY. One-way sensitivity analysis indicated that findings were most sensitive to a parameter capturing PN survival benefit for local-stage patients. CE-acceptability curve showed the probability that the PN program was cost-effective was 0.80 and 0.91 at a societal willingness-to-pay of $50,000 and $100,000/QALY, respectively.

A 3-factor age-period-cohort (APC) model, in which the period variable is replaced by the product of average tar content and adult tobacco consumption per capita, was estimated for the US, UK, Canada and Australia by the maximum likelihood method. Age- and sex-specific tobacco consumption was estimated from historical data on smoking prevalence and total tobacco consumption. Lung cancer mortality was derived from vital registration records. Future tobacco consumption, tar content and the cohort parameter were projected by autoregressive moving average (ARIMA) estimation. The optimal exposure variable was found to be the product of average tar content and adult cigarette consumption per capita, lagged for 25-30 years for both males and females in all 4 countries. The coefficient of the product of average tar content and tobacco consumption per capita differs by age and sex. In all models, there was a statistically significant difference in the coefficient of the period variable by sex. In all countries, male age-standardized lung cancer mortality rates peaked in the 1980s and declined thereafter. Female mortality rates are projected to peak in the first decade of this century. The multiplicative models of age, tobacco exposure and cohort fit the observed data between 1950 and 1999 reasonably well, and time-series models yield plausible past trends of relevant variables. Despite a significant reduction in tobacco consumption and average tar content of cigarettes sold over the past few decades, the effect on lung cancer mortality is affected by the time lag between exposure and established disease. As a result, the burden of lung cancer among females is only just reaching, or soon will reach, its peak but has been declining for 1 to 2 decades in men. Future sex differences in lung cancer mortality are likely to be greater in North America than Australia and the UK due to differences in exposure patterns between the sexes. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.;Age-period-cohort model, Lung cancer mortality, Projections, Tobacco consumption;;;;;;

Design Model-based economic evaluation. Setting Southern Vietnam. Population Males and females aged ?9 years. Methods We simulated dynamic HPV transmission to estimate cervical cancer and genital warts cases. Models were calibrated to epidemiological data from south Vietnam. Main outcome measures Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs): cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Results Vaccinating girls alone was associated with reductions in lifetime cervical cancer risk ranging from 20 to 56.9% as coverage varied from 25 to 90%. Adding boys to the vaccination programme yielded marginal incremental benefits (?3.6% higher absolute cervical cancer risk reduction), compared with vaccinating girls alone at all coverages. At ?25 international dollars (I$) per vaccinated adolescent (I$5 per dose), HPV vaccination of boys was below the threshold of Vietnam's per-capita GDP (I$2800), with ICERs ranging from I$734 per QALY at 25% coverage to I$2064 per QALY for 90% coverage. Including health benefits from averting genital warts yielded more favourable ICERs, and vaccination of boys at I$10/dose became cost-effective at or below 75% coverage. Using a lower cost-effectiveness threshold of 50% of Vietnam's GDP (I$1400), vaccinating boys was no longer attractive at costs above I$5 per dose regardless of coverage. Conclusion Vaccination of boys may be cost-effective at low vaccine costs, but provides little benefit over vaccinating girls only. Focusing on achieving high vaccine coverage of girls may be more efficient for southern Vietnam and similar low-resource settings.

Methods In the proposed uncertainty analysis approach, we calculated the required computational time and the number of runs given a user-defined error bound on the variance of the grand mean. The equations for optimal sample sizes were derived by minimizing the variance of the grand mean using initial estimates for variance components. Finally, analysis of variance estimators were used to calculate unbiased variance estimates. Results To illustrate the proposed approach, we performed uncertainty analysis to estimate the uncertainty associated with total direct cost of osteoarthritis in Canada from 2010 to 2031 according to a previously published population health microsimulation model of osteoarthritis. We first calculated crude estimates for initial-population sampling and dynamic-equation parameters uncertainty by performing a small number of runs. We then calculated the optimal sample sizes and finally derived 95% uncertainty intervals of the total cost and unbiased estimates for variance components. According to our results, the contribution of dynamic-equation parameter uncertainty to the overall variance was higher than that of initial parameter sampling uncertainty throughout the study period. Conclusions The proposed analysis of variance approach provides the uncertainty intervals for the mean outcome in addition to unbiased estimates for each source of uncertainty. The contributions of each source of uncertainty can then be compared with each other for validation purposes so as to improve the model accuracy. © 2017 International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR);methodology, microsimulation, probabilistic sensitivity analysis, uncertainty analysis;;;;;;

Under various assumptions and using past data on CIN grade 3 (CIN3) registrations in England and Scotland, we estimate what cervical cancer rates would have been in the absence of screening. Data on registrations of cervical carcinoma in situ for England and Scotland were used to project the additional numbers of invasive cervical cancers that would have resulted had the carcinoma in situ not been treated. We compare the resulting cervical cancer rates (under different models) with rates recorded in Cancer Incidence in 5 Continents. In order for the projected rates in England and Scotland at ages 20-24 not to be exceptionally high compared to maximum recorded rates for each registry in Cancer Incidence in 5 Continents, the progression rate from CIN3 to invasive cancer in women aged 20-24 should not exceed 1% per year. Similar progression rates were reasonable for women aged 25-29. Under the previously accepted assumption of 4.33% progression per year, cervical cancer rates in women aged 20-29 in both England and Scotland would have been 2-5 times greater than any observed rate (other than one registry, based on just 4 cases). From this analysis, at most 1.5% of women treated (equivalent to 3% of CIN3 registrations) would have had cancer by age 25, whereas it is reasonable to assume that over half of them would have regressed by age 25. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.;Cancer registration, Carcinoma in situ, Cervical cancer, Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, Screening;;;;;;

We employed an ecological correlation study design using countrylevel lung cancer incidence data and associated determinant data. Lagged prevalence of smoking and other exposure data were used to account for exposure-disease latency. A multivariable Poisson model was employed to estimate missed lung cancer in countries lacking incidence data. Projections were further refined to remove potential deaths from infectious/external competing causes. Global lung cancer incidence was much lower among females vs males (13.6 vs 34.2 per 100,000). Distinct spatial heterogeneity was observed for incident lung cancer and appeared concentrated in contiguous regions. Our model predicted a revised global lung cancer incidence in 2012 of 23.6 compared to the Globocan 2012 estimate of 23.1, amounting to ~38,101 missed cases (95% confidence interval: 28,489-47,713). The largest relative under-estimation was predicted for Africa, Central America and the Indian Ocean regions (Comoros, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mayotte, Reunion, Seychelles). Our results suggest substantial underreporting of lung cancer incidence, specifically in developing countries (e.g. Africa). The missed cost of treating these cases could amount to >US$ 130 million based on recent developing setting costs for treating earlier stage lung cancer. The full cost is not only under-estimated, but also requires substantial additional social/family inputs as evidenced in more developed settings like the European Union. This represents a major public health problem in developing settings (e.g. Africa) with limited healthcare resources. © B. Sartorius and K.

Decision tree is one of methods that could be used to evaluate the prognostic factors and classifying the patients' homogeneously. This method identifies the main prognostic factors and then determines the subgroups of patients based on those prognostic factors. The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic factors and homogeneous subgroups of colorectal patient through survival tree. Methods: Data collected from an observational of 739 colorectal patients registered in the cancer registry affiliated to the center of Research Center of Gastroenterology and Liver Disease (RCGLD), Shahid Beheshti Medical University, Tehran, Iran. Death was the interested event and the survival time was calculated from date of diagnosis until occurrence of event (or censoring) in months. Finally we used decision tree based method for classifying and analyzing the data. Results: Based on our result, decision tree identified four covariates as important prognostic factors in 0.05 significant levels: general stage of cancer, age of diagnosis, histology of tumor and morphology type of tumor. Also patients based on these prognostic factors divided into five homogeneous subgroups. The greater values of measure of separation (SEP) criterion support the appropriateness of this model for such the data. Conclusion: Decision tree is powerful and intuitive method. It has a key feature that is in addition to evaluate the prognostic factors, provides the homogeneous subgroups for future analysis.;Colorectal cancer, Decision tree, Homogeneous subgroups, Prognostic factors, Survival analysis,article, cancer morphology, cancer prognosis, cancer registry, cancer staging, cancer survival, colorectal cancer, decision tree, histology, human, major clinical study, survival time;;;;;;

Cancer registry data indicate that their breast cancer survivals are lower than for other women but the completeness and accuracy of Indigenous descriptors on registries are uncertain. We followed women receiving mammography screening in BreastScreen to determine differences in screening experiences and survivals from breast cancer by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status, as recorded by BreastScreen. This status is self-reported and used in BreastScreen accreditation, and is considered to be more accurate. The study included breast cancers diagnosed during the period of screening and after leaving the screening program. Design: Least square regression models were used to compare screening experiences and outcomes adjusted for age, geographic remoteness, socio-economic disadvantage, screening period and round during 1996-2005. Survival of breast cancer patients from all causes and from breast cancer specifically was compared for the 1991-2006 diagnostic period using linked cancer-registry data. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to adjust for socio-demographic differences, screening period, and where available, tumour size, nodal status and proximity of diagnosis to time of screen. Results: After adjustment for socio-demographic differences and screening period, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women participated less frequently than other women in screening and re-screening although this difference appeared to be diminishing, were less likely to attend post-screening assessment within the recommended 28 days if recalled for assessment, had an elevated ductal carcinoma in situ but not invasive cancer detection rate, had larger breast cancers, and were more likely than other women to be treated by mastectomy than complete local excision. Linked cancer registry data indicated that five-year year survivals of breast cancer cases from all causes of death were 81% for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women, compared with 90% for other women, and that the former had larger breast cancers that were more likely to have nodal spread at diagnosis. After adjusting for socio-demographic factors, tumour size, nodal spread and time from last screen to diagnosis, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women had approximately twice the risk of death from breast cancer as other women. Conclusions: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women have less favourable screening experiences and those diagnosed with breast cancer (either during the screening period or after leaving the screening program) have lower survivals that persist after adjustment for socio-demographic differences, tumour size and nodal status.;Australia, Breast cancer, Indigenous status, Screening, Survival;;;;;;

Methods: A Markov model based on a quadrivalent vaccination of 14-year-old girls as recommended in France was performed to assess the number of subjects needed to vaccinate to prevent an HPV-related event during their lifetime and the expected annual number of cases which could be prevented by vaccination. This model was based on prevalence data reported in four large French studies (EDiTH I-IV) reporting an HPV 6/11/16/18 prevalence of 82% (95% CI: 78.5-85.1) in cervical cancer (CC), 64% (95% CI: 59.7-68.1) in CIN2/3, 34% (95% CI: 28.9-38.1) in low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) and 83% (95% CI 77.6-87.8) in female external acuminata condylomata (EAC) cases. Results: Using a theoretical vaccine efficacy of 100%, 130 young women need to be vaccinated to prevent a case of CC, 17 for a case of CIN2/3 and 13 for a case of EAC. Immunization of 80% of 14-year-old girls could prevent 2495 CC (72%), 17,985 CIN2/3 (54%), 8004 CIN1 (27%), and 22,531 EAC female cases (65%) in France annually. Conclusion: A good adhesion to the preferentially recommended HPV quadrivalent vaccination would thus substantially reduce the burden of female genital lesions in France. © 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.

To assess the projected increase in the incidence in 2015 compared with that in 2005, and to determine whether this increase is attributable to changes in risk or in demographics. POPULATION AND METHOD: Bayesian age-period-cohort models were fitted to age-specific rates for 1985-2004 to obtain the expected number of cases for the 5-year periods 2005-2009, 2010-2014 and 2015- 2019. Annual cases were estimated through a polynomial interpolation model. Incidence and mortality data were obtained from the Tarrragona and Gerona cancer registries, while population pyramids for the period 1985-2019 were obtained from the Catalan Institute of Statistics. RESULTS: In Catalonia, 27,438 cancer cases will be diagnosed among men and 19,986 among women in 2015, representing an increase in the number of cases diagnosed of 31% and 34%, respectively, when compared with those diagnosed in 2005 (20,999 and 14,141, respectively). In men, the increases attributable to risk, aging and demographic changes are 10%, 14% and 7%, respectively, whereas in women these changes are 6%, 13% and 15%. In the next decade, cancer mortality is expected to stabilize in men and to continue to decrease in women. Major increases in cancer incidence and mortality are expected among old age groups. CONCLUSIONS: The present study highlights the need to reorganize the resources and infrastructures required for cancer control and care, taking into account the predicted burden of oncology patients. © 2008 Elsevier Espana S.L.;Cancer, Incidence, Mortality, Projections, Risk;;;;;;

In the past few years we published several extensive reviews of our research so a brief review is all that will be provided here. We proposed in the earlier reports that most relapses in breast cancer occur within 5 years of surgery and seem to be associated with some unspecified manner of surgery-induced metastatic initiation. These events can be identified in relapse data and are correlated with clinical data. In the last few years an unexpected mechanism has become apparent. Retrospective analysis of relapse events by a Brussels anesthesiology group reported that a perioperative NSAID analgesic seems to reduce early relapses five-fold. We then proposed that primary surgery produces a transient period of systemic inflammation. This has now been identified by inflammatory markers in serum post mastectomy. That could explain the early relapses. It is possible that an inexpensive and non-toxic NSAID can reduce breast cancer relapses significantly. We want to take this opportunity to discuss database quality issues and our relapse hazard data in some detail. We also present a demonstration that the computer simulation can be calibrated with Adjuvant-on-line, an often used clinical tool for prognosis in breast cancer. © 2014 by the authors, licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.;Bimodal and multimodal relapse patterns, Breast cancer, Database quality, Early relapses, Perioperative NSAID, Surgery, Transient systemic inflammation;;;;;;

The most important issue here is the amount of drug or radiation administrated in chemotherapy and radiotherapy for increasing patient's survival. This is because in these cases, the therapy not only kills the tumor cells, but also kills some of the healthy tissues and causes serious damages. In this paper we investigate optimal drug scheduling effect for breast cancer model which consist of nonlinear ordinary differential time-delay equations. Methods: In this paper, a mathematical model of breast cancer tumors is discussed and then optimal control theory is applied to find out the optimal drug adjustment as an input control of system. Finally we use Sensitivity Approach (SA) to solve the optimal control problem. Results: The goal of this paper is to determine optimal and effective scheme for administering the chemotherapy agent, so that the tumor is eradicated, while the immune systems remains above a suitable level. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of our proposed procedure. Conclusion: In this paper a new scheme is proposed to design a therapy protocol for chemotherapy in Breast Cancer. In contrast to traditional pulse drug delivery, a continuous process is offered and optimized, according to the optimal control theory for time-delay systems.;Breast neoplasm, Chemotherapy, Immune system, Optimal control,article, breast cancer, drug dose regimen, mathematical model, nonlinear system, process design, sensitivity analysis, simulation, tumor immunity;;;;;;

Recently, cure rate models have been introduced to distinguish between clinical determinants of cure and variables associated with the time to event of interest. The aim of this study was to use a cure rate model to determine the clinical associated factors for cure rates of patients with breast cancer (BC). Materials and Methods: This prospective cohort study covered 305 patients with BC, admitted at Shahid Faiazbakhsh Hospital, Tehran, during 2006 to 2008 and followed until April 2012. Cases of patient death were confirmed by telephone contact. For data analysis, a non-mixed cure rate model with Poisson distribution and negative binomial distribution were employed. All analyses were carried out using a developed Macro in WinBugs. Deviance information criteria (DIC) were employed to find the best model. Results: The overall 1-year, 3-year and 5-year relative survival rates were 97%, 89% and 74%. Metastasis and stage of BC were the significant factors, but age was significant only in negative binomial model. The DIC also showed that the negative binomial model had a better fit. Conclusions: This study indicated that, metastasis and stage of BC were identified as the clinical criteria for cure rates. There are limited studies on BC survival which employed these cure rate models to identify the clinical factors associated with cure. These models are better than Cox, in the case of long-term survival.;Breast cancer, Cure rate model, Long-term survival analysis;;;;;;

Methods: We designed a Markov model to compare the clinical and economic impact in terms of reducing the incidence and mortality from colorectal cancer (CRC). Six screening strategies for adults were compared: fecal occult blood (FOBT) immunochemical and guaiac type, conventional colonoscopy, flexible sigmoidoscopy, and FOBT guaiac and immunochemical type more sigmoidoscopy. We used the third-party payer perspective, including only direct costs, the time horizon was the life expectancy of the Colombian population. We estimated cost-effectiveness ratios (CERs) and incremental cost-effectiveness (ICER). Were performed deterministic sensitivity analysis and probabilistic. We applied a discount rate of 3% in the costs and health outcomes. Results: The screening strategy more cost-effective was the FOBT biennial guaiac type. The cost per life year gained was US$10,347.37, US$18,380.64, and US$45,158.05. For FOBT guaiac biennial, FOBT guaiac annual and FOBT inmunoquimica biennial respectively. The ICER is sensitive to the percentage of false positive test for FOBT guaiac type values greater than 10%, and the cost of the test.

Some jurisdictions have already extended HPV vaccination to school-aged boys. Thus, exploration of the cost-utility of adding boys' vaccination is relevant. We modeled the incremental health gain and costs for extending the current girls-only program to boys, intensifying the current girls-only program to achieve 73% coverage, and extension of the intensive program to boys.Methods: A Markov macro-simulation model, which accounted for herd immunity, was developed for an annual cohort of 12-year-olds in 2011 and included the future health states of: cervical cancer, pre-cancer (CIN I to III), genital warts, and three other HPV-related cancers. In each state, health sector costs, including additional health costs from extra life, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were accumulated. The model included New Zealand data on cancer incidence and survival, and other cause mortality (all by sex, age, ethnicity and deprivation).Results: At an assumed local willingness-to-pay threshold of US$29,600, vaccination of 12-year-old boys to achieve the current coverage for girls would not be cost-effective, at US$61,400/QALY gained (95% UI $29,700 to $112,000, OECD purchasing power parities) compared to the current girls-only program, with an assumed vaccine cost of US$59 (NZ$113). This was dominated though by the intensified girls-only program, US$17,400/QALY gained (95% UI: dominant to $46,100). Adding boys to this intensified program was also not cost-effective, US$128,000/QALY gained, 95% UI: $61,900 to $247,000).Vaccination of boys was not found to be cost-effective, even for additional scenarios with very low vaccine or program administration costs - only when combined vaccine and administration costs were NZ$125 or lower per dose was vaccination of boys cost-effective.Conclusions: These results suggest that adding boys to the girls-only HPV vaccination program in New Zealand is highly unlikely to be cost-effective. In order for vaccination of males to become cost-effective in New Zealand, vaccine would need to be supplied at very low prices and administration costs would need to be minimised. © 2014 Pearson et al., licensee BioMed Central Ltd.;,Wart virus vaccine, article, boy, cancer incidence, cancer survival, condyloma acuminatum, cost effectiveness analysis, cost utility analysis, health care cost, mortality, New Zealand, quality adjusted life year, uterine cervix cancer, uterine cervix carcinoma in situ, vaccination, Child, Cohort Studies, Cost-Benefit Analysis, Costs and Cost Analysis, Female, Humans, Immunization Programs, Male, New Zealand, Papillomavirus Infections, Papillomavirus Vaccines, Quality-Adjusted Life Years, School Health Services, Schools, Vaccination;;;;;;

Individual probabilities were projected using Gail's equations and Korean hazard data. We compared the 5-year and lifetime risk produced using the modified Gail model which applied Korean incidence and mortality data and the parameter estimators from the original Gail model with those produced using the KoBCRAT. We validated the KoBCRAT based on the expected/observed breast cancer incidence and area under the curve (AUC) using two Korean cohorts: the Korean Multicenter Cancer Cohort (KMCC) and National Cancer Center (NCC) cohort.Results:The major risk factors under the age of 50 were family history, age at menarche, age at first full-term pregnancy, menopausal status, breastfeeding duration, oral contraceptive usage, and exercise, while those at and over the age of 50 were family history, age at menarche, age at menopause, pregnancy experience, body mass index, oral contraceptive usage, and exercise. The modified Gail model produced lower 5-year risk for the cases than for the controls (p = 0.017), while the KoBCRAT produced higher 5-year and lifetime risk for the cases than for the controls (p<0.001 and <0.001, respectively). The observed incidence of breast cancer in the two cohorts was similar to the expected incidence from the KoBCRAT (KMCC, p = 0.880, NCC, p = 0.878). The AUC using the KoBCRAT was 0.61 for the KMCC and 0.89 for the NCC cohort.Conclusions:Our findings suggest that the KoBCRAT is a better tool for predicting the risk of breast cancer in Korean women, especially urban women. © 2013 Park et al.;,oral contraceptive agent, adult, aged, analytical parameters, article, Asian, body mass, breast cancer, breast feeding, cancer center, cancer incidence, cancer mortality, cancer prognosis, cancer risk, cohort analysis, controlled study, drug use, exercise, family history, female, Gail model, gestational age, human, human tissue, Korean, lifespan, major clinical study, mathematical model, menarche, menopause, onset age, population research, prediction, probability, risk assessment, risk factor, validation process, Adolescent, Adult, Age Factors, Aged, 80 and over, Asian Continental Ancestry Group, Breast Neoplasms, Case-Control Studies, Cohort Studies, Female, Humans, Incidence, Middle Aged, Models, Statistical, Republic of Korea, Risk Assessment, Risk Factors, Young Adult;;;;;;

We therefore explored the possibility of using a combination of faecal tests to prioritize the access to colonoscopy with criteria other than symptoms and/or time of referral. AIMS AND METHODS: We tested a combination of faecal tests [immunochemical faecal occult blood test (i-FOBT), M2-PK, calprotectin] as markers for advanced neoplasia in a selected series of patients requiring colonoscopy for the suspicion of CRC. All the tests were performed in a 1-day stool sample of patients aged 50-80 years, without any dietary restriction, before colonoscopy. RESULTS: A total of 280 patients' stool single samples were analysed. Forty-seven patients had CRC and 85 patients had one or more advanced adenoma(s) at colonoscopy/histology. CRCs were associated with a highly significant increase (P<0.001) in faecal tumour M2-PK (mean 24.2 kU/l), which correlated with Dukes' staging. For CRC detection, i-FOBT was the test with the highest specificity and positive predictive value (0.89 and 0.53), whereas M2-PK had the highest sensitivity and negative predictive value (0.87 and 0.96). Calprotectin showed performance similar to M2-PK in terms of sensitivity and negative predictive value (0.93), but had lower specificity (0.39). The best combination of tests to predict the risk of CRC in this series was i-FOBT+M2-PK, as in patients showing positivity to both markers, the risk of cancer was as high as 79%. CONCLUSION: The combination of i-FOBT and M2-PK is a sensitive tool in clinical practice for the appropriate management of waiting lists for colonoscopy, as it allows the classification of patients into different degrees of priority for investigation, according to their foreseeable risk of CRC.

This study involves a mammography service screening program in Copenhagen, Denmark, with 35,123 women screened at least once. We fit multistate models to the screening data, including preclinical incidence of progressive cancers and nonprogressive (i.e., overdiagnosed) cancers. We estimated mean sojourn time as 2.7 years (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.2-3.1) and screening test sensitivity as 100% (95% CI 99.8-100). Overdiagnosis was estimated to be 7.8% (95% CI 0.3-26.5) at the first screen and 0.5% (95% CI 0.02-2.1) at the second screen. This corresponds to 4.8% of all cancers diagnosed among participants during the first two invitation rounds and following intervals. A modest overdiagnosis was estimated for the Copenhagen screening program, deriving almost exclusively from the first screen. The Cls were very broad, however, and estimates from larger datasets are warranted. ¦. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing, Inc.;Breast, Malignant neoplasms, Mammography, Overdiagnosis, Screening;;;;;;

It provides the perfect opportunity for harnessing the advances that have been made in the control of communicable diseases to attempt the control of noncommunicable diseases. There are possibilities at various levels of intervention, at primary, secondary and tertiary levels, which fit well within a well-planned national cancer control strategy. Prevention should proceed through steps of disruption of transmission, improvement in disease recognition and diagnosis, as well as through prompt effective treatment. This principle should work for both infection and the resultant cancer. Research is very important in understanding how best to use the available knowledge and how best to sequentially implement strategies.

Despite many efforts to develop new dose-volume models for early detection of tumor local failure, there was no reported significant improvement in their application prospectively. Based on recent studies of biomarker proteins' role in hypoxia and inflammation in predicting tumor response to radiotherapy, we hypothesize that combining physical and biological factors with a suitable framework could improve the overall prediction. To test this hypothesis, we propose a graphical Bayesian network framework for predicting local failure in lung cancer. The proposed approach was tested using two different datasets of locally advanced NSCLC patients treated with radiotherapy. The first dataset was collected retrospectively, which comprises clinical and dosimetric variables only. The second dataset was collected prospectively in which in addition to clinical and dosimetric information, blood was drawn from the patients at various time points to extract candidate biomarkers as well. Our preliminary results show that the proposed method can be used as an efficient method to develop predictive models of local failure in these patients and to interpret relationships among the different variables in the models. We also demonstrate the potential use of heterogeneous physical and biological variables to improve the model prediction. With the first dataset, we achieved better performance compared with competing Bayesian-based classifiers. With the second dataset, the combined model had a slightly higher performance compared to individual physical and biological models, with the biological variables making the largest contribution.

Breast cancer mortality can be improved through routine cancer screening, yet migrant populations have lower participation rates. While African migrants are among the fastest growing migrant population in Australia, their breast cancer screening behaviour is under-studied. The aims of this study were to report breast cancer screening status of African migrant women and factors associated with their breast cancer screening behaviour in Australia. Methods: A descriptive, cross-sectional approach was utilised for this study. Two hundred and sixty four African migrant women aged 18-69 years and recruited from a number of organisations responded to a self-reported African version of the Breast Cancer Screening Beliefs Questionnaire (BCSBQ). Main research variables are breast cancer screening practices and demographic characteristics and total scores on each of the BCSBQ subscales. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate the impact of the demographic variables on the likelihood of women in the target age range 50-74 years having screening practices as recommended. Results: While most of the participants heard of breast awareness (76.1%) and mammogram (85.2%), only 11.4% practised monthly breast awareness, whereas 65.9% had ever had a mammogram as frequently as recommended. Age and employment were determining factors for participating in mammogram. Significant different scores were found in the Practical barriers between women at the target age who had and had not performed breast awareness (80.4 versus 77.5, p-value=0.002) and mammogram (77.1 versus 70.3, p-value=0.009) regularly as recommended. Moreover, attitudes towards general health check-ups subscale scores were significantly higher in women who had performed clinical breast examination as frequently as recommended than those who had not. Conclusions: The research reveals that practical barriers and attitudes towards general health check-ups are important factors to take into account in determining African migrant women's participation in breast cancer screening.

Methods: Log and log-linear Poisson regression modelling was fitted to colorectal cancer mortality data for each year between 1950 and 2002 to predict average European age standardized mortality rates (EASMRs) per 100 000 person years (100 000 PY-1) and average numbers of deaths. Results: EASMRs for colon cancer are predicted to fall to 17.3 100 000 PY-1 (95%PI 14.4, 20.2) in men and to 8.4 100 000 PY-1 (95%PI 6.9, 10.2) in women by 2013-17. EASMRs for anorectal cancer are also predicted to fall to 8.0 100 000 PY-1 (95%PI 6.6, 9.5) in men and to 3.0 100 000 PY-1 (95%PI 2.3, 3.8) in women by this time. Truncated EASMRs for colon cancer for those aged between 0 and 64 years are predicted over the next 15 years to fall from their current levels to 4.4 100 000 PY-1 (95%PI 3.0, 5.8) in men and to 2.3 100 000 PY-1 (95%PI 1.5, 3.2) in women. For anorectal cancer, truncated EASMRs for those aged between 0 and 64 years are also predicted over the next 15 years to fall from their current levels to 2.9 100 000 PY-1 (95%PI 2.0, 3.8) in men and to 0.9 100 000 PY-1 (95%PI 0.4, 1.3) in women.

Concern has been expressed that PSA-related increases in incidence will make unaffordable demands on Canadian hospital resources. Our objective is to relate increases in prostate cancer incidence to trends in hospitalizations and in- patient treatment. Methods: Hospitalizations with prostate cancer as primary diagnosis were obtained from the Hospital Morbidity Database, estimates of prostate cancer day surgery from the Discharge Abstract Database, newly diagnosed cases from the Canadian Cancer Registry, and prostate cancer deaths from the Vital Statistics Mortality Databases - all for the years 1981-2000. Results: Between 1981-2000, the number of new cases rose from 7,000 to 18,500 with a transient peak, 1991-1994. Hospitalizations rose parallel to the incidence until 1991 but then fell sharply in spite of further increasing incidence. The use of radical prostatectomy (RP) increased steadily, but transurethral prostatectomy and bilateral orchiectomy decreased in the 1990s. Decreases in length of stay and in number of hospitalizations resulted in considerably decreased annual hospital days for all prostate cancer in-patient procedures except RP, which remained level since 1993. Conclusions: A net decrease in number of in-patient days occurred, despite the increasing number of new prostate cancer cases and the increasing use of radical prostatectomy. We concluded that increases in hospital utilization due to early detection programs, such as PSA testing, are unlikely to overwhelm in-patient services of Canadian hospitals.;Hospital utilization, Orchiectomy, Prostate cancer, Prostatectomy, Surgery, Trends,adult, aged, ambulatory surgery, article, Canada, cancer incidence, cancer mortality, cancer patient, cancer registry, cancer screening, controlled study, correlation analysis, data base, health program, hospital care, hospital discharge, hospital service, hospital utilization, hospitalization, human, length of stay, major clinical study, male, orchiectomy, prostate cancer, prostatectomy, surgical technique, transurethral resection, Adult, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Canada, Databases, Factual, Health Resources, Hospitals, Humans, Incidence, Male, Middle Aged, Orchiectomy, Prostatectomy, Prostatic Neoplasms, Registries, Risk Factors;;;;;;

However, the baseline event incidence for patients without risk factors (incidence_no_risk) may not be reported in the literature, therefore the event incidence in the population (incidence_pop) is commonly used in its place as the baseline. However, this is problematic because incidence_pop is a weighted average of a heterogeneous population. We therefore developed a method for deriving the incidence for persons without risk factors (incidence_no_risk) by adjustment of incidence_pop. We calculated incidence_no_risk using the relative risk for events due to risk factors (RR_risk), incidence_pop, and the prevalence of the risk factor (pRF), which are typically available in the literature. Since the incidence for patient with risk factors (incidence_risk) can be expressed as incidence_risk = incidence_no_risk ? RR_risk, we found that incidence_no_risk = incidence_pop/((RR_risk ? pRF) + (1 ? pRF)). We validated the equation by modeling the fracture incidence in high-risk patients in an osteoporosis transition-state model. With incidence_pop used as the baseline fracture incidence, the model overestimated hip fractures in the study population (10.72 fractures/1000 patient-years). After adjustment of incidence_pop using incidence_no_risk as the baseline incidence, the model accurately predicted hip fractures (2.27/1000 patient-years). Therefore, incidence_no_risk can be calculated using this method based on the event incidence for the study population, the relative risk increase associated with the risk factor, and the prevalence of the risk factor. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland (outside the USA).;,aged, Article, economic evaluation, female, fracture, fragility fracture, high risk patient, hip fracture, human, male, osteoporosis, priority journal, risk factor, spine fracture, very elderly, wrist fracture, complication, computer simulation, economics, Fractures, Bone, incidence, mortality, osteoporosis, statistical model, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Computer Simulation, Fractures, Bone, Humans, Incidence, Male, Models, Econometric, Osteoporosis, Risk Factors;;;;;;

The model incorporated states for human papillomavirus infection (HPV), low-and high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, and cervical cancer stages I-IV to simulate the natural history of HPV infection in a cohort of women from ages 15 to 85 years. The age-specific incidence rate of HPV, and regression and progression rates of HPV and squamous intraepithelial lesions, were obtained from the literature. The effects of varying natural history parameters on cervical cancer incidence were evaluated by using sensitivity analysis. The base-case model resulted in a lifetime cervical cancer risk of 3.67% and a lifetime cervical cancer mortality risk of 1.26%, with a peak incidence of 81/100,000 at age 50 years. Age-specific distributions of precursors were similar to reported data. Lifetime risk of cancer was most sensitive to the incidence of HPV and the probability of rapid HPV progression to high-grade lesions (two- to threefold variations in risk). The model approximates the age-specific incidence of cervical cancer and provides a tool for evaluating the natural history of HPV infection and cervical cancer carcinogenesis as well as the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of primary and secondary prevention strategies.;Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, Cervix neoplasms, Models, theoretical, Papillomavirus, human;;;;;;

In response, Ministry of Health established a cervical cancer screening programme using visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) and treatment of precancerous lesions with cryotherapy. This paper highlights the roll out, integration with family planning services and HIV ART Programme, uptake and challenges of VIA and Cryotherapy programme. Methods: We analyzed program data, supportive supervision, quarterly and annual reports from the National Cervical Cancer Control Program. We evaluated the uptake and challenges of screening services by age, HIV serostatus and trends over a five year period (2011-2015). Results: Between 2011 and 2015, number of cervical cancer screening sites, number of women screened and coverage per annum increased from 75 to 130, 15,331 to 49,301 and 9.3 % to 26.5 % respectively. In this five year period, a total of 145,015 women were screened. Of these, 7,349 (5.1 %) and 6,289 (4.3 %) were VIA positive and suspect cancer respectively. Overall 13,638 (9.4 %) were detected to be VIA positive or had suspect cancer. Of the 48,588 women with known age screened in 2015, 13,642 (28.1 %), 27,275 (56.1 %) and 7,671 (15.8 %) were aged 29 or less, 30-45, 46 years or more. Among 39,101 women with data on HIV serostatus, 21,546 (55.1 %) were HIV negative, 6,209 (15.9 %) were HIV positive and 11, 346 (29.0 %) status was unknown. VIA positivity rate and prevalence of suspect cancer were significantly higher in HIV positive than HIV negative women (8.8 % vs 5.0 %, 6.4 % vs 3.0 %), in women aged 30-45 years than women aged 29 years or less (5.6 % vs 2.3 %, 2.6 % vs 1.2 %) respectively, all p <0.05). The main challenge of the programme was failure to treat VIA positive women eligible for cryotherapy. Over the five year period, the programme only treated 1,001 (43.3 %) out of 2,311 eligible women and only 266 (31.8 %) of the 836 women with large lesion or suspect cancer who were referred, received the health care at the referral centre. The reasons for failure to provide cryotherapy treatment were stock out of gas, faulty/broken cryotherapy machine (usually connectors or probes) or no cryotherapy machine at all in the whole district. For women with large lesion or suspect cancer, lack of loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) machine or inadequate gynaecologists at the referral centre, were the major reasons. Cancer radiotherapy services were not available in Malawi. Conclusions: This study provided data on VIA positivity rate, prevalence of suspect cancer, failure rate of cryotherapy and challenges in the provision of cryotherapy and LEEP treatment in Malawi. These data could be used as baseline for monitoring and evaluation of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination programme which the country introduced in 2013, the linkage of cervical cancer screening and women on HIV ART and the long term effect of ART, voluntary male medical circumcision on the prevalence and incidence of cervical cancer. © 2016 The Author(s).;Cervical cancer, Cryotherapy, Malawi, Sub-Saharan Africa, Visual inspection with acetic acid,adult, cohort analysis, early cancer diagnosis, female, human, Malawi, mass screening, middle aged, procedures, retrospective study, statistics and numerical data, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms, Adult, Cohort Studies, Early Detection of Cancer, Female, Humans, Malawi, Mass Screening, Middle Aged, Retrospective Studies, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;;;;;

A total of 3,874 women from 3 cross-sectional studies in the Netherlands (in 2007-2009) provided vaginal self-samples, which were tested for 25 HPV genotypes by a sensitive molecular assay (SPF10 line probe assay, DDL Diagnostic Laboratory, Voorburg, the Netherlands). The number of concurrent HPV infections per woman was studied by Poisson regression. Associations between HPV types were investigated by generalized estimating equation analyses. The prevalence of any HPV type was 14% in a population-based study, 54% in a chlamydia screening intervention study, and 73% in a study among attendees of sexually transmitted infection clinics. Overall, multiple HPV infections were detected in 26% of the women. The number of concurrent HPV infections conformed to an overdispersed Poisson distribution, even after correction for known risk factors. Types differed significantly in their tendencies to be involved in coinfections, but no evidence for particular type-type interactions was found. Moreover, the strongest associations were observed in the lowest-risk population and vice versa.We found no indications of pairwise interactions, but our findings do suggest that clustering differs among HPV types and varies across risk groups. © 2014 The Author 2014.

Mean 5-year and lifetime risks of developing breast cancer were determined to be 0.6% (SD: 0.2%) and 8.9% (SD: 2.5%), respectively. Variables of family history of breast cancer, age, age at menarche, parity, age at rst childbirth, breastfeeding history, frequency of breastfeeding, method of contraception, marital status and education were all found to be predictors of breast cancer risk.CONCLUSIONS: According to the results of this study, screening programs based on the Gail model should be implemented for Iranian people who have a high risk for breast cancer in order to facilitate early detection and better plan for possible malignancies.;,adult, birth, breast, breast feeding, Breast Neoplasms, cross-sectional study, female, human, Iran, menarche, parity, pathology, physiology, pregnancy, procedures, risk assessment, risk factor, statistical model, women's health, Adult, Breast, Breast Feeding, Breast Neoplasms, Cross-Sectional Studies, Female, Humans, Iran, Menarche, Models, Statistical, Parity, Parturition, Pregnancy, Risk Assessment, Risk Factors, Women's Health;;;;;;

We undertook a public health practice-research partnership to develop a strategy for detecting spatial clusters of early stage breast cancer using registry data. Methods: Spatial patterns of early stage breast cancer throughout Michigan were analyzed comparing several scales of spatial support, and different clustering algorithms. Results: Analyses relying on point data identified spatial clusters not detected using data aggregated into census block groups, census tracts, or legislative districts. Further, using point data, Cuzick-Edwards' nearest neighbor test identified clusters not detected by the SaTScan spatial scan statistic. Regression and simulation analyses lent credibility to these findings. Conclusions: In these cluster analyses of early stage breast cancer in Michigan, spatial analyses of point data are more sensitive than analyses relying on data aggregated into polygons, and the Cuzick-Edwards' test is more sensitive than the SaTScan spatial scan statistic, with acceptable Type I error. Cuzick-Edwards' test also enables presentation of results in a manner easily communicated to public health practitioners. The approach outlined here should help cancer registries conduct and communicate results of geographic analyses. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.;Breast Neoplasms, Carcinoma, Demography, Geographic Information Systems, Population Surveillance;;;;;;

A decision analysis model was created using combined data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) registry public-use database and published results from the Early Lung Cancer Action Project (ELCAP). We found that under optimal conditions in a high risk cohort of patients between 60 and 74 years of age, annual lung cancer screening over a period of 5 years appears to be cost effective at approximately $19 000 per life year saved. A sensitivity analysis of the model to account for a 1-year decrease in survival benefit and changes in assumptions for incidence rate and costs generated cost effectiveness estimates ranging from approximately $10 800 to $62 000 per life year saved. Based on the assumptions embedded in this model, annual screening of high risk elderly patients for lung cancer may be cost effective under optimal conditions, but longer term data are needed to confirm if this will be borne out in practice. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We derived the direct health care costs associated with the lifetime management of an estimated 16,856 patients with a diagnosis of colon and rectal cancer in Canada in 2000. Information on diagnostic approaches, treatment algorithms, follow-up and care at disease progression was obtained from various databases and was integrated into Statistics Canada's Population Health Model (POHEM) to estimate lifetime costs. The average lifetime cost (in Canadian dollars) of managing patients with colorectal cancer ranged from $20,319 per case for TNM stage I colon cancer to $39,182 per case for stage III rectal cancer. The total lifetime treatment cost for the cohort of patients in 2000 was estimated to be over $333 million for colon and $187 million for rectal cancer. Hospitalization represented 65% and 61% of the lifetime costs of colon and rectal cancer respectively. Disease costing models can be important policy-relevant tools to assist in resource allocation. Our results highlight the importance of performing preoperative tests and staging in an ambulatory care setting, where possible, to achieve optimal cost efficiencies.

While some cost-effectiveness analyses have been done for the general elderly population, to our knowledge no study has examined the provision of preventive services to a low-income elderly population. We conducted a study of the cost-effectiveness of a cervical cancer screening program for infrequently screened elderly women attending an urban municipal hospital clinic. The results of Papanicolaou testing were abnormal (malignant or premalignant) in 11 of 816 women screened. This early detection of cervical neoplasia saved $5907 and 3.7 years of life per 100 Papanicolaou tests. When average medical costs per year of life extended by screening were included, the program cost $2874 per year of life saved. Comprehensive sensitivity analyses performed on competing medical and economic points of view did not change the conclusion of a favorable cost-effectiveness ratio for screening. Our findings indicate that the benefits from some prevention programs for the elderly can offset the costs of these programs.

As fewer studies on cancer risk prediction were seen so far, we initially developed an assessment tool with synthesizing key information from a variety of CRC risk factors through a large population-based cohort study. Method: The prediction model was derived from 28,115 men in the Japan Public Health Center-based (JPHC) Prospective Study Cohort II (follow-up: 1993-2005), with risk factors selected by Cox proportion hazard regression. 18,256 men in the JPHC Study Cohort I (follow-up: 1995-2005) were used to evaluate the model's performance. Results: 543 and 398 CRCs were diagnosed during the follow-up period in Cohorts II and I, respectively. The prediction model, including age, BMI, alcohol consumption, smoking status, and the daily physical activity level, showed modest discrimination ability for CRC (C=0.70, 95% confidential interval, 0.68-0.72) in Cohort II and well calibrated in Cohort I (Hosmer-Lemeshow ?2=14.2, P=0.08). Conclusion: The 10-year CRC risk prediction model may be used to estimate CRC risk in Japanese men. It may also play a role in the promotion of CRC prevention strategies. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.;Colorectal cancer, Epidemiologic method, Japanese men, Prospective study, Risk prediction, Validation;;;;;;

Materials and Methods: This is a case-control study that recruited 178 women at 2 Brazilian hospitals. The cases (n = 74) were composed of women with a late diagnosis of a lesion in the uterine cervix (invasive carcinoma in any stage). The controls (n = 104) were composed of women with cervical lesions diagnosed early on (low- or high-grade intraepithelial lesions). The analysis was performed by means of logistic regression model using a hierarchical model. The socioeconomic and demographic variables were included at level I (distal). Level II (intermediate) included the personal and family antecedents and knowledge about the Papanicolaou test and human papillomavirus. Level III (proximal) encompassed the variables relating to individuals' care for their own health, gynecologic symptoms, and variables relating to access to the health care system. Results: The risk factors for late diagnosis of uterine cervical lesions were age older than 40 years (odds ratio [OR] = 10.4,95% confidence interval [CI], 2.3-48.4), not knowing the difference between the Papanicolaou test and gynecological pelvic examinations (OR, = 2.5,95% CI, 1.3-4.9), not thinking that the Papanicolaou test was important (odds ratio [OR], 4.2,95% CI, 1.3-13.4), and abnormal vaginal bleeding (OR, 15.0,95% CI, 6.5-35.0). Previous treatment for sexually transmissible disease was a protective factor (OR, 0.3,95% CI, 0.1-0.8) for delayed diagnosis. Conclusions: Deficiencies in cervical cancer prevention programs in developing countries are not simply a matter of better provision and coverage of Papanicolaou tests. The misconception about the Papanicolaou test is a serious educational problem, as demonstrated by the present study.

The challenge encountered in these studies is the non-identifiability because the disease rate is not identifiable for subjects with negative results from both tests without additional assumptions. Different homogeneous association models have been proposed in the literature to circumvent the non-identifiability problem, which were solved using numerical methods. We propose to formulate the problem as a constrained maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) problem. The MLE has a closed-form in general, which can be solved using a unified two-stage estimation approach. We demonstrate the application of the proposed method on a set of homogeneous association models. The homogeneous association assumptions are generally not testable as all models are saturated. Therefore, we propose an association-ratio plot as a visualization tool for model comparisons. The methods are illustrated through three examples. © SAGE Publications.;dependence, diagnostic test accuracy, homogeneous association, screening studies;;;;;;

In this paper, we studied the variations in the trends of Chinese female breast cancer mortality by age, period and cohort from 1990 to 2009. Methods: The mortality data were collected from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. An age-period-cohort model and Intrinsic Estimator were used to estimate the age effect, period effect and cohort effect on the Chinese adult female breast cancer mortality risk. Results: The age effect on Chinese female breast cancer mortality initially increased, but then declined, and showed a reversed J shape with age. The period effect of breast cancer mortality continued to rise with the time period and increased by 59 % from 1990-1994 to 2005-2009. The cohort effect showed that the mortality risk of Chinese females born after 1911 was on the decline and decreased by 2.2336 from 1911 to 1989. The change rate of the cohort effect on breast cancer mortality fluctuated regularly. Three accelerating decreases and three decelerating decreases were noted in the variation law of the change rate.

A vaccine to prevent diseases due to human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16 and 18 is now available in Spain. The objective of this study was to assess the health and economic impact in Spain of implementing a four-valent HPV vaccine alongside existing screening versus screening alone. Methods. A Markov model of the natural history of HPV infection, incorporating screening and vaccination, was adapted to the Spanish context. A vaccine that would prevent 100% of HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18-associated diseases, with a lifetime duration and 80% coverage, given to girls at age 11 plus current screening was compared to screening alone. The analysis was made from the third-party payer perspective and therefore excluded indirect costs such as loss of productivity. Results. The incremental cost per life years gained (LYG) and per quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained for the introduction of HPV vaccination alongside the Spanish cervical cancer screening programme was 8,657 ˆ and 6,493 ˆ, respectively. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the cost-effectiveness was stable, but was most sensitive to the discount rate used for costs and benefits. Conclusions. These analyses demonstrate that adding a four-valent HPV vaccine to the current screening programme in Spain is a cost-effective strategy for reducing the burden of cervical cancer, pre-cancerous lesions and genital warts.;Cervical cancer screening, Cost-effectiveness, Human papillomavirus, Vaccination;;;;;;
valid;Lam C.L.K.;24755913900,;The price of cancer screening;2004,Hong Kong Practitioner;;;;;;;Effectiveness of a screening test is an essential but not adequate criterion for its application to patient care. The potential benefit has to be balanced against the possible harm and cost of screening. This paper presents a framework on how the price can be balanced against the benefit of cancer screening. The principles are illustrated by modelling cervical cancer and breast cancer screening programmes in the setting of Hong Kong. The estimated price for every cervical cancer death prevented by regular smear screening is 1158 women suffering from psychological harm and HK$2,277,900. The estimated price for every breast cancer death prevented by regular mammography screening is 372 women suffering from psychological harm and HK$6,249,600. Breast cancer screening is about three times more costly than cervical cancer screening but it is associated with fewer women suffering from unnecessary psychological stress.

To obtain estimates of direct health care costs for prostate cancer (PC) from diagnosis to death to inform state transition models. Methods. A stratified random sample of PC patients residing in 3 geographically diverse regions of Ontario, Canada, and diagnosed in 1993-1994, 1997-1998, and 2001-2002, was selected from the Ontario Cancer Registry. We retrieved patients' pathology reports to identify referring physicians and contacted surviving patients and next of kin of deceased patients for informed consent. We reviewed clinic charts to obtain data required to allocate each patient's observation time to 11 PC-specific health states. We linked these data to health care administrative databases to calculate resource use and costs (Canadian dollars, 2008) per health state. A multivariable mixed-effects model determined predictors of costs. Results. The final sample numbered 829 patients. In the regression model, total direct costs increased with age, comorbidity, and Gleason score (all P < 0.0001). Radical prostatectomy was the most costly primary treatment health state ($4676 per 100 days). Radical prostatectomy, hormone-refractory metastatic disease ($6398 per 100 days), and final (predeath) ($13,739 per 100 days) health states were significantly more costly (P < 0.05) than nontreated nonmetastatic PC ($3440 per 100 days), whereas the postprostatectomy ($732 per 100 days) and postradiation ($1556 per 100 days) states cost significantly less (P < 0.0001). Conclusions. This study used an innovative but labor-intensive approach linking chart and administrative data to estimate health care costs. Researchers should weigh the potential benefits of this method against what is involved in implementation. Modifications in methodology may achieve similar gains with less outlay in individual studies. However, we believe that this is a promising approach for researchers wishing to advance the quality of costing in state transition modeling. © The Author(s) 2013.;costs, economic evaluation, prostate cancer;;;;;;

A recently published study suggests that the increase may be at least partly due to reactivation of latent HPV in menopausal women.Methods: We developed a dynamic mathematical model of HPV-16 transmission to estimate the key consequences of hypothetical HPV-16 reactivation in the Australian heterosexual population. We only consider a worst case scenario with regard to reactivation in the Australian setting when all women who are latently infected reactivate and, wherever feasible, we choose model parameter values which may lead to a more pronounced reactivation. The ongoing National HPV vaccination program covering both women and men is incorporated in the model.Results: We estimate that about 1 in 10 women and men who appear to have cleared HPV-16 infection may be latently infected. The prevalence of HPV-16 in older Australian women will increase by a factor of up to 3.1 between now and 2025 which will be accompanied by an increase by a factor of around 1.9 in older men. However, the long-term impact of the HPV vaccination is not significantly altered by reactivation.Conclusions: If the reactivation hypothesis we consider is substantiated, the public health response should be focused on further improvement of cervical screening coverage for older women. Our study also highlights the urgent need for surveillance of HPV prevalence in older Australians. © 2014 Korostil and Regan, licensee BioMed Central Ltd.;HPV latency, Reactivation, Vaccination;;;;;;

The model is compartmental and involves stratification by age, gender and sexual-activity group. Developing this model and a means to calibrate it efficiently is relevant because HPV is a very multi-typed and common sexually transmitted infection with more than 100 types currently known. The two types studied in this paper, types6 and 11, are causing about 90% of anogenital warts.We extend the development of a sexual mixing matrix on the basis of a formulation first suggested by Garnett and Anderson, frequently used to model sexually transmitted infections. In particular, we consider a stochastic mixing matrix framework that allows us to jointly estimate unknown attributes and parameters of the mixing matrix along with the parameters involved in the calibration of the HPV epidemic model. This matrix describes the sexual interactions between members of the population under study and relies on several quantities that are a priori unknown. The Bayesian model developed allows one to estimate jointly the HPV-6 and HPV-11 epidemic model parameters as well as unknown sexual mixing matrix parameters related to assortativity.Finally, we explore the ability of an extension to the class of adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms to incorporate a forward projection strategy for the ordinary differential equation state trajectories. Efficient exploration of the Bayesian posterior distribution developed for the ordinary differential equation parameters provides a challenge for any Markov chain sampling methodology, hence the interest in adaptive Markov chain methods. We conclude with simulation studies on synthetic and recent actual data. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd..;Adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo, Calibration, Forward projection, Genital warts, Human papillomavirus (HPV), Sexual mixing matrix;;;;;;

The asymmetric distribution of smears among the female population and the higher risk incurred by women who never or only occasionally attend screening appear crucial in determining the health effects of screening. An increase in attendance rate induces a substantial rise in health effects and a less than proportionate rise in costs, thus improving cost?effectiveness. Wider screening coverage, in order to increase the number of life?years saved, is achieved more efficiently by encouraging a greater number of women to attend than by inviting the same number of women to attend more often, i.e., with a shorter interval between successive screens. Spontaneous screening is characterized by high coverage for younger women and low coverage for middle?aged and older women. This leads to a small amount of health effects and poor cost?effectiveness as compared with organized screening.

Methods: We used the small-area estimation method to determine the proportion of eligible women by county and racial/ ethnic group. To do so, we included individual and community data in a generalized, linear, mixed-effect model. Results: Our method yielded widely varied estimated proportions of service-eligible women at the county level. In all counties, the estimated proportion of eligible women was higher for Hispanics than for whites, blacks, Asian/Pacific Islanders, or American Indian/Alaska Natives. Across counties, the estimated proportions of eligible Hispanic women varied more than did those of women of other races. Conclusion: The small-area estimation method is a powerful tool for approximating narrowly defined eligible or target populations that are not represented fully in any one data source. The variability and reliability of the estimates are measurable and meaningful. Public health programs can use this method to estimate the size of local populations eligible for, or in need of, preventive health services and interventions.;,adult, article, breast tumor, cluster analysis, epidemiology, ethnic group, ethnology, female, health care delivery, health service, human, mammography, mass screening, middle aged, Monte Carlo method, needs assessment, organization and management, preventive health service, public health, risk assessment, statistics, United States, utilization review, Adult, Breast Neoplasms, California, Ethnic Groups, Female, Health Care Surveys, Health Services Accessibility, Humans, Mammography, Mass Screening, Middle Aged, Monte Carlo Method, Needs Assessment, Preventive Health Services, Public Health, Risk Assessment, Small-Area Analysis, Statistics as Topic, Women's Health Services;;;;;;

The argument is graphical, the outcomes are readily understood by visual and intuitive methods, but a computer program for assisting the calculations is constructed. Use of the method indicates that relatively high rates of screening should be employed in women over 45, and that routine screening in women under 30 years of age is likely to be ineffective in reducing mortality. The method predicts that, if we assume a negative error rate for the test of 0-2, and a natural history with a mean interval between detectability and incurability of about 6 years, a series of 10 tests deployed between 35 and 80 years in England and Wales should give a yield of 0-67 deaths saved per 1000 tests performed, and should be capable of saving about 77% of all deaths from cervical cancer in women who conform with the recommendation. © 1976, The British Empire Cancer Campaign for Research.

In the first step, the authors utilized primary epidemiologic data from a longitudinal study of women in Brazil and identified a plausible range for each input parameter that produced model output within the 95% confidence intervals of the data. In the second step, they performed a simultaneous search over all input parameters to identify parameter sets that produced output consistent with data from multiple sources. A goodness-of-fit score was computed for 555,000 unique parameter sets using a likelihood-based approach, and a sample of good-fitting parameter sets was used in the model to illustrate the advantage of the calibration approach by projecting a range of benefits associated with cervical cancer prevention policies. The calibrated model had reasonable fit to the data in terms of duration and prevalence of HPV infection for high-risk types, prevalence of precancerous lesions, and incidence of cancer. The authors found that leveraging primary data from longitudinal studies provides unique opportunities for model parameterization of the unobservable nature of HPV infection and its role in the development of cervical cancer. © The Author 2007.

Our objective was to quantify the range of additional benefits conferred by second-generation HPV prophylactic vaccines that are expected to expand protection to five additional oncogenic types (31, 33, 45, 52 and 58). Methods: A microsimulation model of HPV and cervical cancer calibrated to epidemiological data from two countries (Kenya and Uganda) was used to estimate reductions in lifetime risk of cervical cancer from the second-generation HPV vaccines. We explored the independent and joint impact of uncertain factors (i.e., distribution of HPV types, co-infection with multiple HPV types, and unidentifiable HPV types in cancer) and vaccine properties (i.e., cross-protection against non-targeted HPV types), compared against currently-available vaccines. Results: Assuming complete uptake of the second-generation vaccine, reductions in lifetime cancer risk were 86.3% in Kenya and 91.8% in Uganda, representing an absolute increase in cervical cancer reduction of 26.1% in Kenya and 17.9% in Uganda, compared with complete uptake of current vaccines. The range of added benefits was 19.6% to 29.1% in Kenya and 14.0% to 19.5% in Uganda, depending on assumptions of cancers attributable to multiple HPV infections and unidentifiable HPV types. These effects were blunted in both countries when assuming vaccine cross-protection with both the current and second-generation vaccines. Conclusion: Second-generation HPV vaccines that protect against additional oncogenic HPV types have the potential to improve cervical cancer prevention. Co-infection with multiple HPV infections and unidentifiable HPV types can influence vaccine effectiveness, but the magnitude of effect may be moderated by vaccine cross-protective effects. These benefits must be weighed against the cost of the vaccines in future analyses. © 2012 Kiatpongsan et al.;,Wart virus vaccine, article, calibration, cancer risk, cross reaction, drug utilization, Human papillomavirus type 31, Human papillomavirus type 33, Human papillomavirus type 45, Human papillomavirus type 52, Human papillomavirus type 58, Kenya, mixed infection, papillomavirus infection, risk reduction, simulation, Uganda, uterine cervix cancer, Coinfection, Cross Protection, Female, Human papillomavirus 16, Human papillomavirus 18, Humans, Kenya, Papillomavirus Vaccines, Uganda, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms, Human papillomavirus;;;;;;

Modeling and economic studies have addressed some of those information needs. We reviewed cost effectiveness studies to find a suitable model for Iranian population to determine the potential cost effectiveness of HPV vaccine program based on domestic available epidemiologic data. Articles were obtained from an extensive literature search to determine the cost effectiveness of implementing an HPV vaccination program with routine cervical cancer screening. A total of 64 studies were included in this review. Although the studies used different model structures, baseline parameters and assumptions (either a Markov, Hybrid, or Dynamic model). Most of the proposed cost effectiveness models need to model the probability of HPV acquisition, the possible progression from HPV infection to CIN I, CIN II, CIN III and cervical cancer, the probability of HPV transmission which are not available in Iranian epidemiologic data. Based on the available epidemiologic data in Iran, the simplified and it requires substantially fewer assumptions than the other more complex Markov and hybrid models, therefore we decided to use this model for the evaluation of cost effectiveness of HPV vaccine in Iran. © 2015 by School of Pharmacy;Cost effectiveness, HPV vaccine, Iran, Simple model,Wart virus vaccine, Article, cancer screening, cost effectiveness analysis, data base, health care cost, human, Iran, literature, model, pharmacoeconomics, quality adjusted life year, systematic review (topic), uterine cervix cancer, virus transmission;;;;;;

Numerous risk factors for colon cancer have been identified, but none are very predictive alone. We sought to determine whether there are certain combinations of risk factors that distinguish well between cases and controls, and that could be used to identify subjects at particularly high or low risk of the disease to target screening. Using data from the Seattle site of the Colorectal Cancer Family Registry, we fit logic regression models to combine risk factor information. Logic regression is a methodology that identifies subsets of the population, described by Boolean combinations of binary coded risk factors. This method is well suited to situations in which interactions between many variables result in differences in disease risk. We found that neither the logic regression models nor stepwise logistic regression models fit for comparison resulted in criteria that could be used to direct subjects to screening. However, we believe that our novel statistical approach could be useful in settings where risk factors do discriminate between cases and controls, and illustrate this with a simulated data set.

However, traditional methods of estimation which do not take spatial heterogeneity into account suffer from drawbacks and their results may be misleading, as the estimated maps of incidence vary dramatically in neighboring areas. Spatial methods have been proposed to overcome drawbacks of traditional methods by including spatial sources of variation in the model to produce smoother maps. Materials and Methods: In this study we analyzed the breast cancer data in Iran during 2004-2008. We used a method proposed to cover spatial and temporal effects simultaneously and their interactions to study trends of breast cancer incidence in Iran. Results: The results agree with previous studies but provide new information about two main issues regarding the trend of breast cancer in provinces of Iran. First, this model discovered provinces with high relative risks of breast cancer during the 5 years of the study. Second, new information was provided with respect to overall trend trends o. East-Azerbaijan, Golestan, North-Khorasan, and Khorasan-Razavi had the highest increases in rates of breast cancer incidence whilst Tehran, Isfahan, and Yazd had the highest incidence rates during 2004-2008. Conclusions: Using spatial methods can provide more accurate and detailed information about the incidence or prevalence of a disease. These models can specify provinces with different health priorities in terms of needs for therapy and drugs or demands for efficient education, screening, and preventive policy into action.;Bayesian disease mapping, Breast cancer, Incidence, Iran, Spatio-temporal information;;;;;;

The burden is mostly attributed to metastatic cancers that occur in one-third of patients and the treatments are palliative. It is of great interest to determine factors affecting time from cancer diagnosis to secondary metastasis. Materials and Methods: Cure rate models assume a Poisson distribution for the number of unobservable metastatic-component cells that are completely deleted from the non-metastasis patient body but some may remain and result in metastasis. Time to metastasis is defined as a function of the number of these cells and the time for each cell to develop a detectable sign of metastasis. Covariates are introduced to the model via the rate of metastatic-component cells. We used non-mixture cure rate models with Weibull and log-logistic distributions in a Bayesian setting to assess the relationship between metastasis free survival and covariates. Results: The median of metastasis free survival was 76.9 months. Various models showed that from covariates in the study, lymph node involvement ratio and being progesterone receptor positive were significant, with an adverse and a beneficial effect on metastasis free survival, respectively. The estimated fraction of patients cured from metastasis was almost 48%. The Weibull model had a slightly better performance than log-logistic. Conclusions: Cure rate models are popular in survival studies and outperform other models under certain conditions. We explored the prognostic factors of metastatic breast cancer from a different viewpoint. In this study, metastasis sites were analyzed all together. Conducting similar studies in a larger sample of cancer patients as well as evaluating the prognostic value of covariates in metastasis to each site separately are recommended.;Bayesian, Breast cancer, Cure model, Metastasis, Survival;;;;;;

Illness perception (IP) and quality of life (QoL) are major issues considering breast cancer management. An attempt was here made to inspect the predictive variables influencing IP and their impact on QoL in cancer patients. The key predictors adapted from previous studies including life satisfaction, perceived social support, self-esteem, hope, optimism, and spiritual well being were taken into account. Our sample included 200 female volunteers suffering from breast cancer applying exclusion criteria. The data were collected using various questionnaires and statistically analyzed by means of path analysis and structural equation modeling. The results revealed that of the six predictors, spiritual well being and social support had direct effects on QoL and IP. The only path with significant indirect correlation with IP was social support. Spiritual well being had the second significant direct effect on IP. Self-esteem occupied the third rank in direct effects on both QoL and IP. In conclusion, here in Iran and most likely in other strongly religious communities, spiritual intervention is an effective strategy to raise QoL.

In this study we developed a prognostic model based on these three indices. Materials and Methods: A total of 243 patients who were initially diagnosed as mCRC between 2005 and 2010 in the Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center were studied. The endpoint was overall survival (OS). Results: NLR>3, elevated GGT and elevated CEA were confirmed as independent risk factors which could predict poor prognosis. Patients could be divided into three groups according to the number of risk factors they had. Those with two or three were defined as the high risk group, individuals with one risk factor as the modest risk group and patients without risk factor as the low risk group. The OS values for these three groups were 16.2 months (2.80?68.8), 24.2 months (4.07?79.0), and 37.2 months (12.6?87.8), respectively (p>0.001).

Objective: The objective of this article is to estimate the impact of adenoma detection rate on the long-term colorectal cancer prevention rate. Methods: A Markov model was constructed to simulate the efficacy and cost of colonoscopy screening according to the adenoma detection rate of the endoscopist in 100,000 individuals. Post-colonoscopy interval colorectal cancer risk and the relative risk of interval cancer among endoscopists with different adenoma detection rates were extracted from the literature. A 1.5 relative risk was assumed between endoscopists with low and average adenoma detection rates, and a relative risk of 11 between those with average and high adenoma detection rates. Both efficacy and costs were projected over a steady-state American population. Results: Screening colonoscopy performed by endoscopists with low adenoma detection rates resulted in a 7% absolute reduction in the long-term colorectal cancer incidence prevention rate as compared to the same procedure performed by those with an average adenoma detection rate (70% vs. 77%). This difference increased to 21% when comparing endoscopists with an average with those with a high adenoma detection rate. When projected on the US population, this reduced efficacy resulted in an additional 1728 and 16,123 colorectal cancer cases and the loss of $117 million and $906 million per year in the two scenarios, respectively. These estimates were sensitive to the risk of post-colonoscopy interval colorectal cancer. Conclusions: A substantial reduction in long-term colorectal cancer prevention rate may be expected when screening colonoscopy is performed by endoscopists with a suboptimal adenoma detection rate. A substantial saving may be expected when implementing policies to improve endoscopist adenoma detection rate. © Author(s) 2015.;Adenoma detection rate, Colonoscopy, Colorectal cancer screening, Cost-effectiveness, Endoscopist, Interval cancer;;;;;;

The current practice of using cumulative mortality ignores both (1) the delay between early treatment and the time that any averted deaths would have otherwise occurred, and (2) cessation of these delayed benefits some time after screening is discontinued. Methods: We use time-specific mortality density ratios to estimate the mortality ratio in the window of influence. We then use time-specific incidence density ratios to assess the extent to which the removal of polyps and other possibly precancerous lesions detected by fecal occult blood screening reduces the incidence of colorectal cancer. Results: Applied to a theoretical example, the current practice of using cumulative mortality substantially underestimates the reduction in mortality achievable by early treatment. If there is sufficient time for the full impact to emerge, time-specific mortality patterns provide a more accurate measure. In a previous analysis of the screening study, the reduction in cumulative incidence in the screened groups was just under 20%. In our reanalysis, yearly incidence density ratios indicate that had screening not been interrupted, there might have been a 40% reduction in incidence. Conclusions: Time-specific mortality ratios provide a more sensitive measure of the effects of early detection and treatment. Measures based on cumulative mortality are diluted by inclusion of deaths that occur soon after the initiation of screening as well as deaths that occur too long after the cessation of screening.

The program uses Monte Carlo simulation. It produces output on the results of screening projects and on the effect of screening on morbidity and mortality on the individual and population level. The calculations are based on models of the natural history of the disease and of the impact of screening on the natural history. The approach is such that considerable flexibility exists in specifying the structure of themodel and its parameters. The program consists of two parts. The DISEASE part can be used for simulating the epidemiology of the disease when no screening is taking place, it requires input on the population and on the disease process. The SCREENING part is to be used in combination with the DISEASE part. It is intended for simulation of the results and effect of a screening project. It requires input on the properties of the screening test, the consequences of early detection by screening, and the policy (ages and intervals between screens) of the project. MISCAN can be used for finding model assumptions regarding the disease process and the impact of screening that give a good explanation of the observed results of a screening project. Such an analysis proceeds in two steps. First, MISCAN is used to calculate simulated results of the project, based on specific assumptions. Next, these results are tested against the observed results, in order to assess the acceptability of the assumptions. MISCAN can also be used for optimization of the screening policy simulating the cost and benefit components of a large number of different screening policies. © 1985.;Cost-benefit analysis Microsimulation, Mass screening, Monte Carlo simulation, Natural history, Screening policy, Screening test;;;;;;

The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficiency of detecting cancer in situ by means of a cytologic smear at different ages, with special emphasis on the benefit of screening in women above the age of 50. We analyzed 466,275 smears taken in an open cohort of 118,890 women in Sweden between 1969 and 1988. The number of cancers in situ detected per 1,000 smears, the detection ratio, was used as an outcome measure in univariate analyses and in multivariate regression models. Cancer/n situ was detected in 1,076 women in the study cohort. The detection ratio peaked at ages 30 to 34 and decreased heavily during the next 15 years of age. The efficiency of taking smears at ages above 50 was only 20 per cent (OR, 0.19, 95% Cl, 0.14–0.26) of that at ages 30 to 34. These results were not changed when adjusting for time period and time interval since the previous smear. In spite of a high incidence of invasive cervical cancer in older women, the benefit of cytologic screening to detect cancer in situ above the age of 50 is uncertain. © 1995 Wiley?Liss, Inc.

Methods: Database including PubMed, Cochrane Library and Chinese BioMed were searched, and studies literatures about the direct health cost of nonsmall-cell lung cancer. Results: Twenty two studies were analyzed in this paper including 20 foreign studies. Normally, international researches about direct medical cost of treating the nonsmall-cell lung cancer investigate total cost from the first diagnosis until several years later. The discrepancy in the results could be explained by different payments, treatment patterns and research methods in different countries. The direct medical cost of nonsmall-cell lung cancer is expensive especially the cost of in-patient. It's increase with the time of therapy. Most of the researches in China about direct medical cost of nonsmall-cell lung cancer focus on per in-patient fees. Conclusion: Facing the increasingly heavy economic burden of nonsmall-cell lung cancer, to lower the incidence of this disease and to reduce the treatment related cost should be taken into account., the prevention of nonsmall-cell lung cancer carcinoma should be enhanced, Such as tobacco control, environment improvement, etc. A proper incentive mechanism should be established. © 2008 Editorial Board of Chin J Evid-based Med.;Health cost, Nonsmall-cell lung cancer;article, cancer diagnosis, China, Cochrane Library, cost of illness, data base, foreign student, health care cost, health care policy, hospital patient, information retrieval, lung non small cell cancer, medical fee, medical research, MEDLINE, methodology;;;;;;

We first examined spatial patterns among 11,728 prostate cancer cases across Connecticut, 1994-98. A spatial scan statistic (SatScan™) identified two locations where average annual incidence rates significantly exceeded the statewide level and two locations with significantly lower disease rates. Extending the analysis to adjust rates for age and race/ethnicity greatly minimized, but did not eliminate, geographic variation. Adjustment for age and poverty level of communities eliminated significant variability across locales. Similarly, analysis adjusted for age and covariation of colorectal cancer incidence rates across the state accounted for all significant variation previously observed.

We developed a Markov state-transition model - the Montreal Prostate Cancer Model - for improved forecasting of the health care requirements and outcomes associated with prostate cancer. We then validated the model by comparing its forecasted outcomes with published observations for various cohorts of men. Methods: We combined aggregate data on the age-specific incidence of prostate cancer, the distribution of diagnosed tumours according to patient age, clinical stage and tumour grade, initial treatment, treatment complications, and progression rates to metastatic disease and death. Five treatments were considered: prostatectomy, radiation therapy, hormonal therapies, combination therapies and watchful waiting. The resulting model was used to calculate age-, stage-, grade- and treatment-specific clinical outcomes such as expected age at prostate cancer diagnosis and death, and metastasis-free, disease-specific and overall survival. Results: We compared the model's forecasts with available cohort data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program, based on over 59 000 cases of localized prostate cancer. Among the SEER cases, the 10-year disease-specific survival rates following prostatectomy for tumour grades 1, 2 and 3 were 98%, 91% and 76% respectively, as compared with the model's estimates of 96%, 92% and 84%. We also compared the model's forecasts with the grade-specific survival among patients from the Connecticut Tumor Registry (CTR). The 10-year disease- specific survival among the CTR cases for grades 1, 2 and 3 were 91%, 76% and 54%, as compared with the model's estimates of 91%, 73% and 37%. Interpretation: The Montreal Prostate Cancer Model can be used to support health policy decision-making for the management of prostate cancer.

Diagnostic test costs were estimated using a micro-costing technique. Sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: The cost to perform 2.7 million cytology tests was nearly 38 million dollars, which represents 26.1% of the total program cost (145.4 million). False negatives account for nearly 43% of the program costs.

Materials and Methods: A total of 2,126 men with clinical stage T1c prostate cancer were treated with radical prostatectomy during 1 of the 3 periods 1989 to 1995, 1995 to 2001 and 2001 to 2005. The respective proportions of men with a tumor that met our criteria for over diagnosis (0.5 cm3 or less, confined to the prostate with clear surgical margins and no Gleason pattern 4 or 5) and under diagnosis (nonorgan confined, pathological stage T3 or greater, or positive surgical margins) were examined. Results: The proportion of men with an over diagnosed tumor was 1.3% to 7.1%. The proportion with prostate cancer that was under diagnosed was 25% to 30%. An ancillary finding was that decreasing the prostate specific antigen threshold for biopsy from 4.0 to 2.5 ng/ml in the screened population resulted in a lower rate of under diagnosis from 30% to 26%, a higher rate of over diagnosis from 1.3% to 7.1% and an increase in the 5-year progression-free survival rate from 85% to 92%. Men who were 55 years or younger were significantly more likely to meet our criteria for over diagnosed cancer. Conclusions: Under diagnosis of prostate cancer continues to occur more frequently than over diagnosis. Lowering the prostate specific antigen threshold for recommending biopsy to 2.5 ng/ml resulted in a lower rate of under diagnosis and a higher progression-free survival rate. © 2007 American Urological Association.;diagnosis, mass screening, prostate, prostate-specific antigen, prostatic neoplasms;;;;;;

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are artificial intelligence software which have been used to assess a few prognostic situations. In this study, a database containing 193 patients from Diagnostic and Monitoring of Tuberculosis and Illness of Lungs Ward in Kuyavia and Pomerania Centre of the Pulmonology (Bydgoszcz, Poland) was analysed using ANNs. Each patient was described using 48 factors (i.e. age, sex, data of patient history, results from medical examinations etc.) and, as an output value, the expected presence of lung cancer was established. All 48 features were retrospectively collected and the database was divided into a training set (n=97), testing set (n=48) and a validating set (n=48). The best prediction score of the ANN model (MLP 48-9-2) was above 0.99 of the area under a receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve. The ANNs were able to correctly classify 47 out of 48 test cases. These data suggest that Artificial Neural Networks can be used in prognosis of lung cancer and could help the physician in diagnosis of patients with the suspicion of lung cancer. © 2014 Versita and Springer-Verlag.;Artificial Neural Networks, Cancer diagnosis, Lung cancer, Risk factors;;;;;;

In contrast to many existing models, our approach permits the impact of interventions to differ after each relapse. We adopt the general model for recurrent events proposed by Pena and Hollander, in which the effect of interventions is represented by an effective age process acting on the baseline hazard rate function. To accommodate the situation of cancer relapse, we propose an effective age function that encodes three possible therapeutic responses: complete remission, partial remission, and null response. The proposed model also incorporates the effect of covariates, the impact of previous relapses, and heterogeneity among individuals. We use our model to analyse the times to relapse for 63 patients with a particular subtype of indolent lymphoma and compare the results to those obtained using existing methods.

This may be explained by risk factors common to all HPV infections, but type-specific biological factors may also play a role. This raises the question of whether widespread use of the quadrivalent vaccine (covering HPV6, 11, 16, 18) may indirectly affect the prevalence of any non-vaccine types. Routine screening samples from 5014 Danish women were tested for 35 HPV genotypes (including 13 high-risk) using the Genomica CLART® HPV2 kit, which is a low-density microarray based on PCR amplification. Simulation studies were performed both under independence between genotypes and under a common dependence structure as would arise from common risk factors, and simulation results were compared to observed coinfection patterns. Overall HPV prevalence was 37.4%, with multiple infections in 17.9%. For 15 HPV types of primary interest (13 high-risk plus HPV6, 11), almost all pairs occurred more often than expected under independence, 33/105 (31.4%) were statistically significant (p&lt,0.05 after adjustment for multiple comparisons). The pairwise odds ratios showed significant heterogeneity (Woolf's test p&lt,0.0001). For simulations based on common dependence, three pairs had observed to expected (O/E) ratios significantly different than 1 (31/68, O/E=4.20, 51/68, O/E=2.52, 33/58, O/E=3.27, all p&lt,0.05 after adjustment for multiple comparisons). HPV68 occurred in multiple infections nearly four times as often as expected under common dependence (p&lt,0.005 after adjustment for multiple comparisons). These results indicate some interaction between HPV types, and suggest that common risk factors do not entirely explain the observed HPV coinfection pattern, although no evidence is found that the prevalence of any types not targeted by the quadrivalent vaccine may be indirectly increased or decreased after widespread use of the vaccine. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.;Cervical cancer, Coinfection, Denmark, HPV vaccination, Human papillomavirus;;;;;;

Methods: This study was a historical cohort study and the data gathered from 1,219 registered CRC patients between January 2002 and October 2007 at the Research Center for Gastroenterology and Liver Disease of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. For determining the risk factors and survival prediction of patients, neural network (NN) and Cox regression models were used, utilizing R 2.12.0 software. Results: One, three and five-year estimated survival probability in colon patients were 0.92, 0.71, and 0.48 and for rectum patients were 0.86, 0.71, and 0.42, respectively. By the ANN model, pathologic distant metastasis, pathologic regional lymph nodes, tumor grade, high risk behavior, pathologic primary tumor, familial history and tumor size variables were determined as ordered important factors for colon cancer. Tumor grade, pathologic stage, age at diagnosis, tumor size, high risk behavior, pathologic distant metastasis and first treatment variables were ordered important factors for rectum cancer. The ANN model lead to more accurate predictions compared to the Cox model (true prediction of 89.0% vs. 78.6% for colon and 82.7% vs. 70.7% for rectum cancer patients). Conclusion: This study showed that ANN model is a more powerful tool in survival prediction and influential factors of the CRC patients compared to the Cox regression model. Therefore, this model is recommended for predicting and determining of risk factors of these patients.;Artificial neural network, Colorectal cancer, Cox regression, Prediction, Survival analysis;,,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858022470;;;;;;

Patients and Methods: Data for 1,871 men with initial negative biopsies and at least one follow-up biopsy were available. Piecewise exponential regression models were developed to quantify hazard ratios (HRs) and define cumulative incidence curves for PCa detection for subgroups with specific patterns of risk factors over time. Factors evaluated included age, race, serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration, PSA slope, digital rectal examination, dysplastic glands or prostatitis on biopsy, ultrasound gland volume, urinary symptoms, and number of negative biopsies. Results: Four hundred sixty-five men had PCa detected, after a mean follow-up time of 2.8 years. All of the factors were independent predictors of PCa detection except for PSA slope, as a result of its correlation with time-dependent PSA level, and race. PSA (HR = 3.90 for > 10 v 2.5 to 3.9 ng/mL), high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia/atypical glands (HR = 2.97), gland volume (HR = 0.39 for > 50 v < 25 mL), and number of repeat biopsies (HR = 0.36 for two v zero repeat biopsies) were the strongest predictors. Men with high-risk versus low-risk event histories had a 20-fold difference in PCa detection over 5 years. Conclusion: Piecewise exponential models provide an approach to longitudinal analysis of PCa risk that allows clinicians to see the interplay of risk factors as they unfold over time for individual patients. With these models, it is possible to identify distinct subpopulations with dramatically different needs for monitoring and repeat biopsy. © 2010 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.;,prostate specific antigen, prostate specific membrane antigen, article, cancer diagnosis, cancer incidence, digital rectal examination, human, human tissue, longitudinal study, major clinical study, male, priority journal, prostate biopsy, prostate cancer, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, prostatitis, risk factor, tumor volume, adult, aged, biopsy, middle aged, pathology, proportional hazards model, prostate tumor, statistical model, time, Adult, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Biopsy, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Models, Statistical, Proportional Hazards Models, Prostatic Neoplasms, Risk Factors, Time Factors;;;;;;

This study focuses on the effectiveness of treatment of pre malignant cervical conditions (CIN III) on cervical-cancer incidence in the county of Sor-Trondelag in Norway, prior to the introduction of organized mass screening. The study is based on cervical-cancer incidence rates during the years 1965-92 and treatment data for CIN III. The expected number of cervical-cancer cases prevented due to early intervention was expressed in a regression model with 2 unknown parameters: the probability, p, of cancer development in case of CIN III, and the time lag, t, between treatment and when clinical cancer would otherwise have been diagnosed. The estimated probability that a patient treated for CIN III would have developed cervical cancer if not treated was found to be approximately 20%, and the mean time delay was around 16 years. In the last period of study (1988-92), the incidence was reduced by nearly 40% of what would have been expected without early intervention. Based on equal treatment rates as in 1990, parameter estimates were used to predict future incidence reduction. Maximum effectiveness will be achieved around the year 2005, with a nearly 70% reduction. Opportunistic screening and treatment of CIN III seems to have had considerable influence on cervical-cancer incidence. The costs, however, are substantial over-treatment, since our results indicate that 4 of 5 women treated for CIN III would not progress into the invasive state.;,adult, aged, article, cancer incidence, cancer prevention, cancer screening, female, human, major clinical study, norway, priority journal, uterine cervix cancer, Adult, Age Factors, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Carcinoma in Situ, Female, Humans, Mass Screening, Middle Aged, Norway, Precancerous Conditions, Regression Analysis, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;;;;;;

Methods: A cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) examined the specific costs and health outcomes associated with (1) no screening, (2) only the Pap test, (3) only self-administered HPV, (4) only clinician administered HPV, and (5) clinician administered HPV plus the Pap test. The costs of self- and clinician-HPV testing, as well as with the Pap test, were identified and quantified. Costs were reported in 2008 US dollars. The health outcome associated with these screening strategies was defined as the number of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or cervical cancer cases detected. This CEA was performed using the perspective of the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) in Morelos, Mexico. Results: Screening women between the ages of 30-80 for cervical cancer using clinical-HPV testing or the combination of clinical-HPV testing, and the Pap is always more cost-effective than using the Pap test alone. Conclusions: This CEA indicates that HPV testing could be a cost-effective screening alternative for a large health delivery organization such as IMSS.

Methods: A Markov model was constructed to predict and compare the effect of four esophageal cancer endoscopic screening modalities which varied with different screening ages. Long-term epidemiological effectiveness and cost-effectiveness were predicted by simulation of the model. Results: Compared with the control group, strategies starting at 40, 45, 50 and 55 year-old had saved life-years of 629.51 , 769.88, 738.98 and 533.21 years per 100 000 people, respectively, of which the strategy starting at 45 year-old saved the maximum life years. All strategies were cost-effective and starting at 40 year-old cost the most per life-year saved. Among all alternatives, strategies starting age at 45 year-old and 50 year-old were incremental cost-effective, and the incremental cost-effective ratios were 34 962.87 and 3 346.43 RMB per life year saved, respectively. Conclusions: The strategy starting at 40 year-old implemented at present and other strategies were cost-effective in high-risk areas of rural China. However, the 45-year-old group is more aligned with the principle of cost-effectiveness. Considering the cost-effectiveness of different strategies and social economic status, 45 year-old is regarded as the optimal starting age of esophageal cancer once-in-a-lifetime endoscopic screening and is recommended in areas lacking health resources. The strategy of starting age at 40 year-old which could obtain better screening effects would be preferable in wealthy regions.

The aim of this study is to project observed trends of mortality in France for lung and breast cancer among females to 2021. Projections of mortality rates are based on a Bayesian age-period-cohort model and a Poisson distribution. We used cancer mortality data from the French mortality register (period 1977-2006) and population data from population registers (estimated for 1977-2006 and projected for period 2007-2021 using five scenarios: largest, smallest, youngest, older, average population). Alternative models were tested (generalized additive model, negative binomial distribution).For the average population scenario, lung and breast cancer mortality rates age-standardized to the world population, are respectively: 11.5 per 105 women (Credibility interval: 10.3-12.8) and 15.9 (14.4-17.6) in 2007-2011, 14.6 (11.7-18.1) and 14.5 (11.6-18.0) in 2012-2016, 18.2 (12.6-26.0) and 13.3 (9.1-18.9) in 2017-2021.Projections show an ongoing increase for lung cancer and decrease for breast cancer mortality rates, which are expected to be equal in 2012-2016. Compared projections of these two cancers using a similar method had not been done before. Aggressive prevention strategies targeting smoking among women are needed to control this fast growing epidemic of avoidable cancer.

With an improved compliance with screening a larger reduction of cervical cancer incidence would be within reach. We aimed at investigating why certain women do not attend Pap smear screening and at validating the reliability of self-reported screening. Methods. In 1998 in the county of Uppsala, Sweden, information was collected through telephone interviews with 430 nonattendees and 514 attendees to Pap smear screening, who were all sampled from a population-based database. The women's recall of attendance was validated against the database. The main outcome measures used were odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results. Non-attendance was positively associated with nonuse of oral contraceptives (OR = 3.56, 95% CI 2.18-5.83), seeing different gynecologists (OR = 1.90, 95% CI 1.34-2.70), and seeing a physician very often (OR = 3.12, 95% CI 1.45-6.70) or not at all (OR = 1.78, 95% CI 1.09-2.90). Frequent condom use (OR = 1.88, 95% CI 1.02-3.47), living in rural/semirural areas (OR = 1.55, 95% CI 1.07-2.21), and not knowing the recommended screening interval (OR = 2.16, 95% CI 1.20-3.89) were all associated with nonattendance, whereas socioeconomic status was not, when tested in a multivariate model. Among the nonattendees, 57% underestimated the time lapse since last smear. Conclusions. Seeing a gynecologist on a regular basis and information guiding women to have a Pap smear on their own initiative are important factors for recurrent screening. Therefore, information should be given to all women about the purpose and benefits of Pap smear testing. Self-reports on screening should be treated with caution. © 2001 American Health Foundation and Academic Press.;Cervical cancer, Nonattendance, Pap smear screening;;;;;;

A cross-sectional study was set up in seven French districts using a self-administered postal questionnaire. Randomization was stratified proportionally on age and urban/rural status in each district separately among attendees and nonattendees to the organized breast cancer screening programme (OS). A total of 5638 women aged 50-74 years returned their questionnaires: 1480 in the attendee OS group and 4158 in the nonattendee group. Among them, 3537 declared having undergone a recent mammography outside the organized programme (individual, IS group) and 621 declared never having undergone a mammography or having done so more than 2 years ago (NS group). Analyses showed a gradient between the three groups (IS, OS and NS, respectively) in their association with breast cancer screening practices considering three factors: an increasing gradient was observed for renunciation of basic healthcare for financial reasons, a decreasing gradient in the regular visit to a medical gynaecologist and having had a Pap smear in the last 3 years. Three other variables that showed a decreasing gradient are: living with a partner, current use of hormone replacement therapy and having had a check-up in the last 5 years. In conclusion, the main differences between breast cancer screening practices were largely associated with difficulties in healthcare access, considering regular gynaecological visits in particular. © 2008 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.;Breast cancer screening, France, Healthcare access, Mammography, Mass screening, Sociodemographic status;;;;;;

The model consists of a set of integro-differential equations describing the dynamics of tumor cells under the effects of mutation and competition phenomena, interactions with cytokines regulating cell proliferation as well as the action of cytotoxic drugs and targeted therapeutic agents. Asymptotic analysis and simulations, developed with an exploratory aim, are addressed to enlighten the role played by the biological phenomena under consideration in the dynamics of hepatocellular carcinoma, with particular reference to the intra-tumor heterogeneity and the response to therapies. The obtained results suggest that cancer progression selects for highly proliferative clones. Moreover, it seems that intra-tumor heterogeneity makes targeted therapeutic agents to be less effective than cytotoxic drugs and a joint action of these two classes of agents may mutually increase their efficacy. Finally, it is highlighted how targeted therapeutic agents might act as an additional selective pressure leading to the selection for the most fitting, and then most resistant, cancer clones. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.;Cancer modeling and therapy, Concentration phenomena, Evolution, Hepatocelular carcinoma, Structured populations;cytokine, cytotoxic agent, cancer, chemotherapy, concentration (composition), drug resistance, mutation, numerical model, article, cancer cell, cancer growth, cell proliferation, controlled study, cytokine release, gene mutation, in vitro study, liver cancer, liver cell carcinoma, mathematical model, priority journal, Antineoplastic Agents, Carcinoma, Hepatocellular, Cell Proliferation, Cytokines, Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition, Evolution, Molecular, Hepatocytes, Humans, Liver Neoplasms, Models, Biological, Molecular Targeted Therapy, Mutation, Selection, Genetic;;;;;;

We aimed to assess the probability of being statistically cured from CLM by hepatic resection.Methods: Data from 1,012 consecutive patients undergoing curative resection for CLM (2001–2012) were used to fit a nonmixture cure model to compare mortality after surgery to that expected for the general population matched by sex and age.Results: The 5- and 10-year disease-free survival was 18.9 and 15.8 %, the corresponding overall survival was 44.3 and 32.7 %. In the entire study population, the probability of being cured from CLM was 20 % (95 % confidence interval 16.5–23.5). After the first year, the mortality excess of resected patients, in comparison to the general population, starts to decline until it approaches zero 6 years after surgery. After 6.48 years, patients alive without tumor recurrence can be considered cured with 99 % certainty. Multivariate analysis showed that cure probabilities range from 40.9 % in patients with node-negative primary tumors and metachronous presentation of a single lesion <3 cm, to 1.5 % in patients with node positivity, and synchronous presentation of multiple, large CLMs. A model for the calculation of a cure fraction for each possible clinical scenario is provided.Conclusions: Using a cure model, the present results indicate that statistical cure of CLM is possible after hepatectomy, providing this information can help clinicians give more precise answer to patients’ questions. © 2014, Society of Surgical Oncology.;,aged, cancer staging, Colorectal Neoplasms, female, follow up, human, Liver Neoplasms, liver resection, lymph node metastasis, male, middle aged, mortality, multivariate analysis, pathology, prognosis, secondary, statistical model, survival rate, tumor invasion, Aged, Colorectal Neoplasms, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Hepatectomy, Humans, Liver Neoplasms, Lymphatic Metastasis, Male, Middle Aged, Models, Statistical, Multivariate Analysis, Neoplasm Invasiveness, Neoplasm Staging, Prognosis, Survival Rate;;;;;;

A better understanding of the financial burden that cancer places on Taiwan's National Health Insurance (NHI) is important for helping policy makers to plan under scarce healthcare resources. This study attempts to estimate lifetime health expenditure for patients with 17 types of major cancers. Methods: A total of 425,294 patients, each of whom was registered in Taiwan during 1990 to 2001 as having one of 17 major types of cancers, were included. All of them were followed until the end of 2004. Monte Carlo simulation was used to extrapolate survival for up to 600 months to derive the life expectancy or lifetime survival function after diagnosis for different cancers. The average annual health expenditure per case for each cancer type was calculated by using data from the NHI's reimbursement database. The lifetime health expenditure per case was estimated by multiplying the monthly survival probability by the average monthly health expenditure, adjusting for the annual discount rate and the medical care inflation rate. By incorporating the number of annual incidence cases, the total lifetime health expenditure can also be estimated. Results: Of the 17 cancers studied, it was found that leukemia had the highest average annual health expenditure per case (207,000 TWD) as well as the highest lifetime health expenditure per case (2,404,000 TWD, without discounting adjustment). Breast cancer had the highest total lifetime health expenditure (5046 million TWD) because of the longer life expectancy and chronic morbidity. Furthermore, colorectal cancer had the second highest total lifetime health expenditure (4995 million TWD) due to its high incidence. Conclusion: The proposed method is a feasible way of estimating lifetime health expenditure for cancer patients even under high censoring rates. This would be helpful for cost-effectiveness assessment of cancer prevention programs and for policy planning. © 2008 Elsevier & Formosan Medical Association.;Cancer, Health expenditure, Health insurance, Monte Carlo method;;;;;;

Our model is illustrated using the example of smoking-induced lung cancer. METHODS:: The model was fitted on a case-control study nested in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study, including 757 incident cases and 1524 matched controls. Estimation was done through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, and simulations based on the posterior estimates of the parameters were used to provide measures of model fit. We performed sensitivity analyses to assess robustness of our findings. RESULTS:: After adjusting for its impact on exposure duration, age was not found to independently drive the risk of lung carcinogenesis, whereas age at starting smoking in ever-smokers and time since cessation in former smokers were found to be influential. Our data did not support an age-dependent time to diagnosis. The estimated time between onset of malignancy and clinical diagnosis ranged from 2 to 4 years. Our approach yielded good performance in reconstructing individual trajectories in both cases (sensitivity >90%) and controls (sensitivity >80%). CONCLUSION:: Our compartmental model enabled us to identify time-varying predictors of risk and provided us with insights into the dynamics of smoking-induced lung carcinogenesis. Its flexible and general formulation enables the future incorporation of disease states, as measured by intermediate markers, into the modeling of the natural history of cancer, suggesting a large range of applications in chronic disease epidemiology.

The model uses a Markov process and is populated using published evidence and local data. The robustness of the results has been tested using sensitivity analysis. Three treatment policies of 'monitoring' (observation), radical prostatectomy, or a selection-based management policy using DNA-ploidy as an experimental marker, have been evaluated. Modelling indicates that a policy of managing these tumours utilising experimental markers has an estimated cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) of ?12068. Sensitivity analysis shows the results to be relatively sensitive to quality-of-life variables. If novel and experimental markers can achieve specificity in excess of 80%, then a policy of radical surgery for those identified as being at high risk and conservative treatment for the remainder would be both better for patients and cost-effective. The analysis suggests that a radical prostatectomy treatment policy for the moderately graded tumours (Gleason grades 5-7) modelled in this paper may be inferior to a conservative approach in the absence of reliable prognostic markers, being both more costly and yielding fewer QALYs. © 2003 Cancer Research UK.;Cost-effectiveness, DNA-ploidy, Prognostic marker, Prostate cancer;;;;;;

Prediction tools have been developed to assist the treatment of the disease. Methods. A retrospective review was performed of the Irish Prostate Cancer Research Consortium database and 603 patients were used in the study. Statistical models based on routinely used clinical variables were built using logistic regression, random forests and k nearest neighbours to predict prostate cancer stage. The predictive ability of the models was examined using discrimination metrics, calibration curves and clinical relevance, explored using decision curve analysis. The N = 603 patients were then applied to the 2007 Partin table to compare the predictions from the current gold standard in staging prediction to the models developed in this study. Results: 30% of the study cohort had non organ-confined disease. The model built using logistic regression illustrated the highest discrimination metrics (AUC = 0.622, Sens = 0.647, Spec = 0.601), best calibration and the most clinical relevance based on decision curve analysis. This model also achieved higher discrimination than the 2007 Partin table (ECE AUC = 0.572 & 0.509 for T1c and T2a respectively). However, even the best statistical model does not accurately predict prostate cancer stage. Conclusions: This study has illustrated the inability of the current clinical variables and the 2007 Partin table to accurately predict prostate cancer stage. New biomarker features are urgently required to address the problem clinician's face in identifying the most appropriate treatment for their patients. This paper also demonstrated a concise methodological approach to evaluate novel features or prediction models. © 2013 Boyce et al., licensee BioMed Central Ltd.;Calibration, Discrimination, Model evaluation, Prediction models, Prostate cancer;;;;;;

We generated small-area estimates for being current with colorectal cancer screening to examine sociogeographic differences among states and counties. To our knowledge, nationwide county-level estimates for colorectal cancer screening are rarely presented. Methods: We used county data from the 2014 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS, n = 251,360 adults), linked it to the American Community Survey poverty data, and fitted multilevel logistic regression models. We post-stratified the data with the U.S. Census population data to run Monte Carlo simulations. We generated county-level screening prevalence estimates nationally and by race/ethnicity, mapped the estimates, and aggregated them into state and national estimates. We evaluated internal consistency of our modeled state-specific estimates with BRFSS direct state estimates using Spearman correlation coefficients. Results: Correlation coefficients were >0.95, indicating high internal consistency. We observed substantial variations in current colorectal cancer screening estimates among the states and counties within states. State mean estimates ranged from 58.92% in Wyoming to 75.03% in Massachusetts. County mean estimates ranged from 40.11% in Alaska to 79.76% in Florida. Larger county variations were observed in various race/ethnicity groups. Conclusions: State estimates mask county variations. However, both state and county estimates indicate that the country is far behind the 80% by 2018 target. Impact: County-modeled estimates help identify variation in colorectal cancer screening prevalence in the United States and guide education and enhanced screening efforts in areas of need, including areas without BRFSS direct-estimates. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.;,adult, aged, Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Article, behavioral risk factor surveillance system, California, cancer epidemiology, cancer screening, colonoscopy, Colorado, colorectal cancer, Connecticut, controlled study, Delaware, District of Columbia, female, Florida, geographic distribution, Georgia (U.S.), Hawaii, human, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, major clinical study, male, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Monte Carlo method, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, priority journal, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming;;;;;;

Using Swedish nationwide data on incidence and mortality, we analysed trends during more than 3 decades and fitted Poisson-based age-period-cohort models, and also investigated whether screening has reduced the incidence of adenocarcinomas of the cervix. The incidence of reported cancer in situ increased rapidly during 1958-1967. Incidence rates of squamous cell cancer, fairly stable before 1968, decreased thereafter by 4-6% yearly in women aged 40-64, with a much smaller magnitude in younger and older women. An age-cohort model indicated a stable 70-75% reduction in incidence for women born 1940 and later compared with those born around 1923. The incidence of adenocarcinomas doubled during the 35-year study period. The mortality rate increased by 3.6% before 1968 and decreased by 4.0% yearly thereafter. Although a combination of organized and opportunistic screening can reduce the incidence of squamous cell cancer substantially, the incidence of adenocarcinomas appears uninfluenced by screening.;Adenocarcinoma, Age-period-cohort models, Cervical cancer, Cytological screening, Squamous cell cancer;;;;;;

Economic evaluations and national guidance have been produced for individual treatments for bowel cancer. However, it has been suggested that Primary Care Trusts develop program budgeting or equivalent methodology demonstrating a whole system approach to investment and disinvestment. The objective of this study was to provide a baseline framework for considering a whole system approach to estimate the direct costs of bowel cancer services provided by the National Health Service (NHS) in England. Methods: A treatment pathway, developed in 2005, was used to construct a service pathway model to estimate the direct cost of bowel cancer services in England. Results: The service pathway model estimated the direct cost of bowel cancer services to the NHS to be in excess of 1 billion in 2005. Thirty-five percent of the cost is attributable to the screening and testing of patients with suspected bowel cancer, subsequently diagnosed as cancer-free. Conclusions: This study is believed to be the most comprehensive attempt to identify the direct cost of managing bowel cancer services in England. The approach adopted could be useful to assist local decision makers in identifying those aspects of the pathway that are most uncertain in terms of their cost-effectiveness and as a basis to explore the implications of re-allocated resources. Research recommendations include the need for detailed costs on surgical procedures, high-risk patients and the utilization of the methods used in this study across other cancers.

In order to determine the overall impact of mammography screening, activity data collected from the second screening round (1996-1997) were compared with expected activity levels in the case no screening had taken place in this time period. The direct health care costs associated with the screening activity, excluding effects on treatment and diagnostics but including women's transport and time costs, were estimated at DKK 305 per attendee. The cost of clinical mammography decreases with the introduction of screening due to a decrease in the total number of women undergoing this introductory diagnostic activity, while surgery costs increases, whereas cost incurred by adjuvant treatment and treatment of recurrences will be significantly reduced. Overall, inclusion of effects on course of treatment decreases the net cost of screening by 30-40% to DKK 208 and DKK 128 including and excluding the women's time and transport costs, respectively.

It is the third leading cause of cancer-dependent death in the world. In Iran the incidence of colorectal cancer has increased during the last 25 years. Materials and Methods: In this article we analyzed the survival of 447 colorectal patients of Taleghani hospital in Tehran using parametric competing-risks models. The cancers of these patients were diagnosed during 1985-2012 and followed up to 2013. The purpose was to assess the association between survival of patients with colorectal cancer in the presence of competing-risks and prognostic factors using parametric models. The analysis was carried out using R software version 3.0.2. Results: The prognostic variables included in the model were age at diagnosis, tumour site, body mass index and sex. The effect of age at diagnosis and body mass index on survival time was statistically significant. The median survival for Iranian patients with colorectal cancer is about 20 years. Conclusions: Survival function based on Weibull model compared with Kaplan-Meier survival function is smooth.

Therefore, different novel screening methods and technologies to diagnose and treat the disease in its early stages are of high importance for health systems. The present study aimed to investigate the epidemiological trend, and clinical and treatment indices of breast cancer by collecting available information from Seyed-Al-Shohada Hospital, in Isfahan during 1981-2006. Methods: All available data at Oncology Center of Isfahan Province, related to 1981-2006 were encoded and analyzed. Age groups of the patients, along with all cases of cancer recorded by Statistical Center of Iran, were calculated. After age specific rating (ASR), the resulted indices were evaluated. The frequency of clinical indices, such as tumor, metastasis, chemotherapy, and breast conserving surgery, as well as the frequency of age groups among patients, and the ASR pattern were calculated. Correlational tests and mean comparison were used to analyze the data. Results: Among 4652 breast cancer patients, 98.6% were female and 1.35% were male. Total ASR for breast cancer was calculated as 13 in 1996, 14.1 in 2001, and 18.21 in 2006 in the province of Isfahan. The values were then compared with the rate in the country (25.6) during 2006. The age of patients was 48.79 ± 11 years with 34.65% aging 40-50, and 26.7% aging less than 40 years. The ASR was estimated as approximately 57 in every 100,000 for age groups of 41-50, 51-60, and 61-70. Categorization of patients based on frequency among different age groups and frequency based on ASR did not result in an identical pattern. The relative frequency of tumor sizes obtained from the patients were T1 = 7.6%, T2 = 61.2%, T3 = 27.2% and T4 = 3.8%. In addition, an increasing trend of chemotherapy was observed during the studied period with 71.2% of the patients receiving the treatment. The tendency to perform breast conserving surgery is growing recently and 8.9% of the cases undergone the surgery during 2002-2006. Conclusion: The increasing trend of ASR may indicate improved screening methods, staff training development, and modern disease detection equipments. The data proves that compared with most western countries, Iran is in a low risk region. However, changing people's lifestyle and increasing trend in breast cancer incidence would be a matter of caution for the health system. © 2012, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences(IUMS).

A questionnaire survey was administered among female adolescents in schools and clinics. Descriptive statistics including frequencies, percentages and proportions were generated for independent variables and bivariate analyses (Chi square test) were used to assess the relationship between independent and outcome variables. Data were analyzed using SAS Version 9.2. Out of a sample of 650 adolescent girls 553 willingly participated in this anonymous survey. Awareness of HPV (86.8%), cervical cancer (82.3%), and prevention of HPV infections through vaccination (75.9%) was significantly higher than in previous studies conducted in Cameroon and other developing countries. Higher perceptions of risk were associated with being sexually active (p = 0.0013), age (p = 0.0031) and level of education (p = 0.0274). Age and educational level were associated with HPV knowledge (p = 0.007 and p = 0.0008), respectively. The mean level of interest in HPV vaccination was 4.0 (SD = 1.27), which is above the mean. Our data indicate high awareness about HPV, cervical cancer and HPV vaccine among adolescents, and interest in receiving the vaccine and learning about the disease. CBCHS' community education strategy effectively raised acceptability and generated demand for HPV vaccine, making it a potential model for HPV immunization in Cameroon and other developing countries. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.;Adolescents, Attitudes, Cameroon, Cervical cancer, HPV, Vaccine;;;;;;

Methods: With 16 years of prospective data from a large cohort of U.S. women ages 25-58 years, we conducted a breast cancer risk assessment for 87,392 premenopausal women by applying the Rosner-Colditz biomathematical risk prediction model to estimate breast cancer risk based on known risk factors. On the basis of each woman's comprehensive risk factor profile, we calculated the predicted 1-year incidence rate (IR) per 100,000 person-years and estimated incidence rate ratios (IRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for lesbian and bisexual women compared with heterosexual women. Results: A total of 87,392 premenopausal women provided 1,091,871 person-years of data included in analyses. Mean predicted 1-year breast cancer IRs per 100,000 person-years for each sexual orientation group were heterosexual, 122.55, lesbian, 131.61, and bisexual, 131.72. IRs were significantly elevated in both lesbian (IRR, 1.06, 95% CI, 1.06-1.06) and bisexual (IRR, 1.10, 95% CI, 1.10-1.10) women compared with heterosexual women. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that both lesbian and bisexual women have slightly elevated predicted breast cancer incidence compared with heterosexual women throughout the premenopausal period. Impact: Health professionals must ensure that breast cancer prevention efforts are reaching these women. As more health systems around the country collect data on patient sexual orientation, the National Cancer Institute's SEER cancer registry should add this information to its data system to monitor progress in reducing sexual orientation-related disparities in cancer incidence and mortality. ©2012 AACR.;,adult, article, bisexual female, breast cancer, cancer incidence, cancer risk, controlled study, female, heterosexual female, human, lesbian, major clinical study, model, prediction, premenopause, priority journal, Rosner Colditz Risk Prediction Model, sexual orientation, United States, Adult, Aged, Bisexuality, Breast Neoplasms, Cohort Studies, Female, Homosexuality, Female, Humans, Incidence, Longitudinal Studies, Middle Aged, Models, Statistical, Premenopause, Prospective Studies, Questionnaires, Risk, United States;;;;;;

Methods: 572 men who underwent trans-rectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy from February, 2013 to September, 2014 participated in the study. Prostate configuration based on digital rectal examination, serum PSA level, and prostate volume were recorded. Pathologic outcomes were categorized in two groups: adenocarcinoma vs. noncancerous reports. A multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network was designed in which total PSA, free PSA, age, rectal examination results and prostate volume were vectors. Results: 566 men with the average age of 65.9 ± 8.6 years. Average total and free PSA levels were 19.77 ± 50.03 ng/mL and 2.46 ± 8.36 ng/mL respectively. Average free to total PSA ratio was 14.68 ± 11.24%. Prostate size was 58.58 ± 31.64CC on average. Age, total PSA, prostate volume and abnormal DRE were correlated with prostate cancer at biopsy, and the most powerful of all was abnormal DRE with odds ratio of 0.12. Neural networks were formed on a 3-layer perceptron and finally a network of 6 entry, 9 middle, and 2 output nodes was selected with the learning rate of 0.05. The Correct prediction rate for the model was 85.3%. Conclusions: It seems that our three-layer perceptron neural network model proves better results than the logistic regression model in predicting the presence of prostate cancer based on total and free PSA, DRE result, prostate volume and age. © 2017, International Journal of Cancer Management.;Iranian men, Neural network, Prediction model, Prostate cancer;prostate specific antigen, adult, age distribution, aged, Article, artificial neural network, biological model, cancer classification, controlled study, digital rectal examination, dynamic model, human, human tissue, image guided biopsy, Iranian people, major clinical study, male, perceptron, perceptron neural network, predictive value, prostate adenocarcinoma, prostate biopsy, prostate cancer, prostate volume, receiver operating characteristic, transrectal ultrasonography;;;;;;

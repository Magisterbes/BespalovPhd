A computer model for the study of breast cancer.;Carter KJ1, Castro F, Kessler E, Erickson B.;Comput Biol Med. 2003 Jul.33(4):345-60.;Abstract A computer model was designed as a relational database to assess breast cancer screening in a cohort of women where the growth and development of breast cancer originates with the first malignant cell. The concepts of thresholds for growth, axillary spread, and distant sites are integrated. With tumor diagnosis, staging was performed that includes clinical and sub-clinical states. The model was parameterized to have staging characteristics similar to data published by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End-Results (SEER) Program. Validation was accomplished by comparing simulated staging results with non-SEER sources, and simulated survival with independent clinical survival data.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology,Breast Neoplasms/mortality,Breast Neoplasms/pathology*,Computer Simulation*,Female,Humans,Incidence,Life Expectancy,Lymphatic Metastasis,Neoplasm Metastasis,SEER Program,Software,United States/epidemiology;12791407;

A model to optimize public health care and downstage breast cancer in limited-resource populations in southern Brazil. (Porto Alegre Breast Health Intervention Cohort).;Caleffi M1, Ribeiro RA, Duarte Filho DL, Ashton-Prolla P, Bedin AJ Jr, Skonieski GP, Zignani JM, Giacomazzi J, Franco LR, Graudenz M, Pohlmann P, Fernandes JG, Kivitz P, Weber B.;BMC Public Health. 2009 Mar 13.9:83. doi: 10.1186/1471-2458-9-83.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Breast cancer (BC) is a major public health problem, with rising incidence in many regions of the globe. Although mortality has recently dropped in developed countries, death rates are still increasing in some developing countries, as seen in Brazil. Among the reasons for this phenomenon are the lack of structured screening programs, a long waiting period between diagnosis and treatment, and lack of access to health services for a large proportion of the Brazilian population. METHODS AND DESIGN: Since 2004, an intervention study in a cohort of women in Southern Brazil, denominated Porto Alegre Breast Health Intervention Cohort, is being conducted in order to test the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a model for BC early detection and treatment. In this study, over 4,000 women from underserved communities aged 40 to 69 years are being screened annually with mammography and clinical breast examination performed by a multidisciplinary team, which also involves nutritional counseling and genetic cancer risk assessment. Risk factors for BC development are also being evaluated. Active search of participants by lay community health workers is one of the major features of our program. The accrual of new participants was concluded in 2006 and the study will last for 10 years. The main goal of the study is to demonstrate significant downstaging of BC in an underserved population through proper screening, attaining a higher rate of early-stage BC diagnoses than usually seen in women diagnosed in the Brazilian Public Health System. Preliminary results show a very high BC incidence in this population (117 cases per 100,000 women per year), despite a low prevalence of classical risk factors. DISCUSSION: This study will allow us to test a model of BC early diagnosis and treatment and evaluate its cost-effectiveness in a developing country where the mortality associated with this disease is very high. Also, it might contribute to the evaluation of risk factors in a population with a different ethnic background from that studied in developed countries. If our model is proven effective, it may be replicated in other parts of the globe where BC is also a major public health problem.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Brazil/epidemiology,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology,Breast Neoplasms/ethnology,Cohort Studies,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Early Diagnosis,Female,Humans,Mammography/economics,Mass Screening/economics*,Middle Aged,Models, Economic,Risk Factors,Surveys and Questionnaires;19284670;
A modelling study to evaluate the costs and effects of lowering the starting age of population breast cancer screening.;;Maturitas. 2018 Mar.109:81-88. doi: 10.1016/j.maturitas.2017.12.009. Epub 2017 Dec 15.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Because the incidence of breast cancer increases between 45 and 50years of age, a reconsideration is required of the current starting age (typically 50years) for routine mammography. Our aim was to evaluate the quantitative benefits, harms, and cost-effectiveness of lowering the starting age of breast cancer screening in the Dutch general population. METHODS: Economic modelling with a lifelong perspective compared biennial screening for women aged 48-74years and for women aged 46-74years with the current Dutch screening programme, which screen women between the ages of 50 and 74years. Tumour deaths prevented, years of life saved (YOLS), false-positive rates, radiation-induced tumours, costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were evaluated. RESULTS: Starting the screening at 48 instead of 50 years of age led to increases in: the number of small tumours detected (4.0%), tumour deaths prevented (5.6%), false positives (9.2%), YOLS (5.6%), radiation-induced tumours (14.7%), and costs (4.1%). Starting the screening at 46 instead of 48 years of age increased the number of small tumours detected (3.3%), tumour deaths prevented (4.2%), false positives (8.8%), YOLS (3.7%), radiation-induced tumours (15.2%), and costs (4.0%). The ICER was ¯õ?5600/YOLS for the 48-74 scenario and ¯õ?5600/YOLS for the 46-74 scenario. CONCLUSIONS: Women could benefit from lowering the starting age of screening as more breast cancer deaths would be averted. Starting regular breast cancer screening earlier is also cost-effective. As the number of additional expected harms is relatively small in both the scenarios examined, and the difference in ICERs is not large, introducing two additional screening rounds is justifiable.

A projection of benefits due to fecal occult blood test for colorectal cancer.;Wu D1, Erwin D, Rosner GL.;Cancer Epidemiol. 2009 Oct.33(3-4):212-5. doi: 10.1016/j.canep.2009.08.001. Epub 2009 Sep 4.;Abstract OBJECTIVES: A prospective study to estimate benefits due to fecal occult blood tests for colorectal cancer are carried out for both males and females, under different screening frequencies. METHODS: We apply the statistical method developed by Wu et al. (2007) [1] using the Minnesota colorectal cancer study group data, to make Bayesian inference for the lead time, the time of diagnosis advanced by screening for both male and female participants in a periodic screening program. The lead time is distributed as a mixture of a point mass at zero and a piecewise continuous distribution. The two parts of the mixture correspond to two aspects of the screening: the probability of no benefit, or the percentage of interval cases. and the probability distribution of the early diagnosis time. We present estimates of these two measures for males and females by simulation studies using the Minnesota study group data. We also provide the mean, mode, variance, and density curve of the program's lead time by gender. This may provide policy makers important information on the effectiveness of the FOBT screening in colorectal cancer early detection. RESULTS: The mean lead time increases as the screening time interval decreases for both males and females. The standard error of the lead time also increases as the screening time interval decreases for both genders. Females seem get more benefit than males, in that females usually have a longer lead time than males if both take the test at the same time interval and the lead time mode for females is greater than that of males in the same screening time interval. CONCLUSION: According to the predictive estimation of the lead time distribution, to guarantee a 90% chance of early detection, it seems necessary for the males to take the fecal occult blood test every 9 months, while the females can take it annually.;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Adult,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Bayes Theorem,Colorectal Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Female,Health Policy,Humans,Male,Mass Screening/methods*,Middle Aged,Occult Blood*,Sex Factors,Time Factors,R03 CA115012/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,R03 CA115012-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,CA-115012/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;19733140;
A proposal for an evidence-based model of the screening for the colorectal carcinoma in an Italian setting.;Costantino C1, Calamusa G, Cusimano R, Firenze A, Romano N, Trecca A, Vitale F.;J Prev Med Hyg. 2011 Dec.52(4):191-5.;Abstract INTRODUCTION: The aim of this paper is to improve the feasibility perception of policymakers, health care workers and target population about the cost-effectiveness of the implementation of colorectal screening as Public Health strategy. METHODS: Retrospective study by application of a three-step model designed for a local setting in Sicily (Palermo and its Province) in order to distribute Fecal Occult Blood Tests (FOBTs), offer colonoscopy and surgery, by district allocation of pharmacies, public digestive endoscopic centres and oncologic and general surgery units. Mean adherence to consolidated colorectal screening programs in Italy was applied in order to evaluate the feasibility of an operative model in our area. RESULTS: Applying the model to the target population (269,368 individuals of both sexes), it can be expected a mean percentage of 79% delivered invitation and a mean participation rate of 46.3% accounting for a total of 213,070 invited individuals and 98,651 participating in the first round of the program. Furthermore, considering the national mean of 6% positive FOBT, 82% of colonscopy adhesion and 7% CRC detection rate, it can be scheduled a burden for health care structures involved in the program accounting for 49,325 FOBTs, 2,338 colonscopies and 141 surgeries for each year. DISCUSSION: This work demonstrates the feasibility of a colorectal screening project in our area, showing a sustainable impact for local health care involved structures. Furthermore, this program may be spread as an applicative model to other areas, adapting the project to the needs of the local setting in which the colorectal screening will be organized.;Carcinoma/diagnosis,Carcinoma/economics,Carcinoma/prevention & control,Colonoscopy,Colorectal Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Colorectal Neoplasms/economics,Colorectal Neoplasms/prevention & control,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Feasibility Studies,Female,Humans,Italy,Male,Mass Screening*/economics,Models, Economic*,Occult Blood,Retrospective Studies;22442924;
A simulation model for evaluating the medical and economic outcomes of screening strategies for colorectal cancer.;Lejeune C1, Arveux P, Dancourt V, Fagnani F, Bonithon-Kopp C, Faivre J.;Eur J Cancer Prev. 2003 Feb.12(1):77-84.;Abstract Mathematical models have been shown to be useful in predicting the cost-effectiveness of cancer screening programmes. We designed a computer macro-simulation model aimed at predicting the cost-effectiveness of alternative colorectal cancer screening strategies. This model was built to determine the cost-effectiveness of a biennial screening programme using the Hemoccult test in Burgundy (France). It was validated with data from the Danish randomized study. Estimates of our model showed an extremely close concordance with observed results in the Danish study. The observed mortality reduction was 18.0% and the estimated mortality reduction was 18.4%. Preliminary data from the Burgundy study predict a 14.6% colorectal cancer mortality reduction after 10 years. Sensitivity analyses were performed with different assumptions regarding the participation rates and the lead-time. This model can serve to assess the cost-effectiveness of a variety of screening modalities.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Aged,Cohort Studies,Colorectal Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Colorectal Neoplasms/economics*,Computer Simulation,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Denmark,Female,Forecasting,France,Humans,Male,Mass Screening/economics*,Middle Aged,Models, Theoretical*,Occult Blood*,Predictive Value of Tests;12548114;

An alternative cost effectiveness analysis of ThinPrep in the Australian setting.;Neville AM1, Quinn MA.;Aust N Z J Obstet Gynaecol. 2005 Aug.45(4):289-94.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical and economic impacts of the use of liquid based cytology (LBC) in the Australian average risk population from the perspective of the public health care budget. BACKGROUND: Concerns over the evaluation of medical technologies in Australia, which are assessed by the Medicare Services Advisory Committee (MSAC), have been raised recently. We report on the evaluation of LBC, which although being widely adopted in other parts of the world, has, despite substantial uptake in the private sector in Australia, been rejected for public funding by MSAC. METHODS: We used the health economic model developed by MSAC, but populated the model with the best available international data, sourced from a published review article. The economic model considered the clinical benefits and the costs arising from a biennial cervical screening programme. Net costs divided by life years saved is the cost per life year saved and this is reported as the incremental cost effectiveness. RESULTS: Populating the MSAC model with data on test performance showed that one type of LBC (ThinPrep) 'dominates' the conventional Pap smear in the screening of average risk women in the Australian setting. CONCLUSION: The health economic model created by MSAC predicts that ThinPrep dominates the conventional Pap as a screening test for cervical cancer. An additional 2240 high-grade lesions could be detected, resulting in 480 life years gained and delivering an expected saving to the health care system of $5,536,000 per annum if liquid based cytology replaced the conventional Pap.;Australia,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Female,Health Care Costs*,Humans,Models, Economic,Monte Carlo Method,National Health Programs*,Papanicolaou Test*,Sensitivity and Specificity,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/economics*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/pathology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/therapy,Vaginal Smears/economics*,Vaginal Smears/methods*;16029294;
An assessment of existing models for individualized breast cancer risk estimation in a screening program in Spain.;Arrospide A, Fornƒ? C, Ruƒ? M, Torƒÿ N, Mar J, Barƒ? M1.;BMC Cancer. 2013 Dec 10.13:587. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-13-587.;Abstract BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the calibration and discriminatory power of three predictive models of breast cancer risk. METHODS: We included 13,760 women who were first-time participants in the Sabadell-Cerdanyola Breast Cancer Screening Program, in Catalonia, Spain. Projections of risk were obtained at three and five years for invasive cancer using the Gail, Chen and Barlow models. Incidence and mortality data were obtained from the Catalan registries. The calibration and discrimination of the models were assessed using the Hosmer-Lemeshow C statistic, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and the Harrell's C statistic. RESULTS: The Gail and Chen models showed good calibration while the Barlow model overestimated the number of cases: the ratio between estimated and observed values at 5 years ranged from 0.86 to 1.55 for the first two models and from 1.82 to 3.44 for the Barlow model. The 5-year projection for the Chen and Barlow models had the highest discrimination, with an AUC around 0.58. The Harrell's C statistic showed very similar values in the 5-year projection for each of the models. Although they passed the calibration test, the Gail and Chen models overestimated the number of cases in some breast density categories. CONCLUSIONS: These models cannot be used as a measure of individual risk in early detection programs to customize screening strategies. The inclusion of longitudinal measures of breast density or other risk factors in joint models of survival and longitudinal data may be a step towards personalized early detection of BC.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Aged,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Early Detection of Cancer,Female,Follow-Up Studies,Humans,Incidence,Mass Screening,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical*,Reproducibility of Results,Risk*,Spain/epidemiology;24321553;
An evaluation of screening policies for cervical cancer in England and Wales using a computer simulation model.;;J Epidemiol Community Health. 1986 Jun.40(2):143-53.;Abstract Several screening policies have been recommended for implementation in England and Wales in the last 20 years, although no evidence as to their relative effectiveness or efficiency has been provided. Using a computer simulation model, the outcomes expected from those policies had they been implemented over a 30 year period (1961-90) have been examined. The original policies based on five-yearly testing of women aged over 35 appear to be the most cost-effective, and extension of screening to younger age groups leads to loss of efficiency. Attempts to use non-screening health care contacts in order to take cervical smears (eg, during pregnancy, family planning, at gynaecology clinics) produce few advantages and considerably complicate the establishment of regular testing for the individual. The achievement of higher attendance rates is as important to the outcome of screening as concentration on more intensive or complex policies.;Adult,Aged,Computers,England,Evaluation Studies as Topic,Female,Health Policy*/economics,Humans,Mass Screening/economics,Mass Screening/organization & administration*,Middle Aged,Models, Theoretical,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/mortality,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Wales;3746177;

Annual Combined Mammography and Tomosynthesis Screening: Is It Really Cost-Effective?;Lee CI1,2,3, Lee JM1,3, Tosteson AN4.;AJR Am J Roentgenol. 2016 Nov.207(5):1156-1158. Epub 2016 Aug 17.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: Examining the comparative effectiveness of adding tomosynthesis to mammography screening in the United States would help key stakeholders, including physicians and policy makers, guide shared decision-making and recommendations for routine breast cancer screening.

Annual number of lung cancer deaths potentially avertable by screening in the United States.;;Cancer. 2013 Apr 1.119(7):1381-5. doi: 10.1002/cncr.27813. Epub 2013 Feb 25.;Abstract BACKGROUND: The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), which was conducted between 2002 and 2009, demonstrated that screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) reduced lung cancer mortality by 20% among screening-eligible populations compared with chest x-ray. In this article, the authors provide an estimate of the annual number of lung cancer deaths that can be averted by screening, assuming the screening regimens adopted in the NLST are fully implemented in the United States. METHODS: The annual number of lung cancer deaths that can be averted by screening was estimated as a product of the screening effect, the US population size (obtained from the 2010 US Census data), the prevalence of screening eligibility (estimated using the 2010 National Health Interview Survey [NHIS] data), and the lung cancer mortality rates among screening-eligible populations (estimated using the NHIS data from 2000-2004 and the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey linked mortality files). Analyses were performed separately by sex, age, and smoking status, with Poisson regression analysis used for mortality rate estimation. Uncertainty of the estimates of the number of avertable lung cancer deaths was quantified by simulation. RESULTS: Approximately 8.6 million Americans (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 8.0 million-9.2 million), including 5.2 million men (95% CI, 4.8 million-5.7 million) and 3.4 million women (95% CI, 3.0 million -3.8 million), were eligible for lung cancer screening in 2010. If the screening regimen adopted in the NLST was fully implemented among these screening-eligible US populations, a total of 12,250 (95% CI, 10,170-15,671) lung cancer deaths (8990 deaths in men and 3260 deaths in women) would be averted each year. CONCLUSIONS: The data from the current study indicate that LDCT screening could potentially avert approximately 12,000 lung cancer deaths per year in the United States. Further studies are needed to estimate the number of avertable lung cancer deaths and the cost-effectiveness of LDCT screening under different scenarios of risk, various screening frequencies, and various screening uptake rates.

Are increases in mammographic screening still a valid explanation for trends in breast cancer incidence in the United States?,1995,Cancer Causes and Control ; Wun L.-M., Feuer E.J., Miller B.A. ;; A number of studies have attributed much of the sharp increase in breast cancer incidence in the United States during the 1980s to the increased detection through mammography. The most recent breast cancer data from the US National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program show that the incidence trend has slowed, while results from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) of 1987 and 1990 indicate that the percentage of women receiving mammograms continues to increase. This phenomenon suggested the need to reassess the relationship between increasingly early detection of breast cancer and overall incidence trends. A polynomial age-cohort model was used to establish the secular trend in incidence rates excluding the impact of recent increases in detection due to the rising use of mammography. Based on the model, the incidence trend in the youngest age group (40 to 49 years) would peak and then begin to decline in the early 1980s. This pattern would manifest itself later in successively older age groups as these younger cohorts age. Breast cancer trends are seen to be generally consistent with the impact of the increased use of mammography when its effect is superimposed upon the background of declining or slowing secular trends. These results support previous reports linking incidence rates with the increase in screening-mammography. ? 1995 Rapid Communications of Oxford Ltd. ; Age-cohort model, breast cancer incidence, lead-time effect, screening-mammography, secular trend, United States,age, article, breast cancer, cancer screening, dose time effect relation, female, human, mammography, priority journal, united states, Adult, Aged, Breast Neoplasms, Cohort Studies, Female, Human, Incidence, Mammography, Middle Age, Models, Statistical, United States ; ;

Benefits and costs of using HPV testing to screen for cervical cancer.;Mandelblatt JS1, Lawrence WF, Womack SM, Jacobson D, Yi B, Hwang YT, Gold K, Barter J, Shah K.;JAMA. 2002 May 8.287(18):2372-81.;Abstract CONTEXT: Despite quality assurance standards, Papanicolaou (Pap) test characteristics remain less than optimal. OBJECTIVE: To compare the societal costs and benefits of human papillomavirus (HPV) testing, Pap testing, and their combination to screen for cervical cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND POPULATION: A simulation model of neoplasia natural history was used to estimate the societal costs and quality-adjusted life expectancy associated with 18 different general population screening strategies: Pap plus HPV testing, Pap testing alone, and HPV testing alone every 2 or 3 years among hypothetical longitudinal cohorts of US women beginning at age 20 years and continuing to 65 years, 75 years, or death. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Discounted costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) saved of each screening strategy. RESULTS: Maximal savings in lives were achieved by screening every 2 years until death with combined HPV and Pap testing at an incremental cost of $76 183 per QALY compared with Pap testing alone every 2 years. Stopping biennial screening with HPV and Pap testing at age 75 years captures 97.8% of the benefits of lifetime screening at a cost of $70 347 per QALY. Combined biennial HPV and Pap testing to age 65 years captures 86.6% of the benefits achievable by continuing to screen until age 75 years. Human papillomavirus screening alone was equally effective as Pap testing alone at any given screening interval or age of screening cessation but was more costly and therefore was dominated. In sensitivity analyses, HPV testing would be more effective and less costly than Pap testing at a cost threshold of $5 for an HPV test. CONCLUSIONS: Screening with HPV plus Pap tests every 2 years appears to save additional years of life at reasonable costs compared with Pap testing alone. Applying age limits to screening is a viable option to maintain benefits while reducing costs.;Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.,Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.,Adult,Aged,Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/diagnosis,Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/economics,Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/prevention & control,Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/virology,Cost-Benefit Analysis,DNA, Viral/analysis,Female,Humans,Mass Screening/economics*,Mass Screening/methods,Middle Aged,Models, Theoretical,Papanicolaou Test*,Papillomaviridae/isolation & purification*,Papillomavirus Infections/diagnosis*,Polymerase Chain Reaction/economics,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,Tumor Virus Infections/diagnosis*,United States,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/economics,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/virology*,Vaginal Smears/economics*,DNA, Viral,R01-AG15340/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States;11988058;

Breast cancer incidence trends in Norway and estimates of overdiagnosis.;van Luijt PA1, Heijnsdijk EA1, van Ravesteyn NT1, Hofvind S2, de Koning HJ1.;J Med Screen. 2017 Jun.24(2):83-91. doi: 10.1177/0969141316668379. Epub 2016 Oct 17.;Abstract Objective Fluctuations in the incidence of breast cancer in Norway in the last three decades are partly explained by the use of hormone replacement therapy and mammography screening, but overdiagnosis has also been suggested as a cause. We assessed the trends in breast cancer incidence and overdiagnosis in Norway. Methods We calibrated our microsimulation model to Norwegian Cancer Registration data. The model takes into account the use of mammography (both within and outside the Norwegian Breast Cancer Screening Programme) and of hormone replacement therapy. We obtained a proper fit of breast cancer incidence in recent years, when assuming an increase in the background risk for breast cancer, and estimated overdiagnosis. Results We estimated a 2% overdiagnosis rate as a fraction of all cancers diagnosed in women aged 50-100, and a 3% overdiagnosis rate as a fraction of all cancers diagnosed in women aged 50-70 (i.e. screening age). If all of the increased incidence would be the result of the detection of slow growing tumours, these estimates were 7% and 11%, respectively. Conclusion Besides mammography and hormone replacement therapy use, additional risk factors contributed to the sudden increase in breast cancer incidence in Norway. Overdiagnosis estimates due to screening were within the range of international plausible estimates.;Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology,Calibration,Early Detection of Cancer/methods,Female,Hormones/therapeutic use,Humans,Incidence,Mammography/methods*,Mass Screening/methods*,Medical Overuse*,Middle Aged,Norway/epidemiology,Registries,Risk Factors,Hormones;27754936;
Breast cancer risk assessment in women aged 70 and older.;Vacek PM1, Skelly JM, Geller BM.;Breast Cancer Res Treat. 2011 Nov.130(1):291-9. doi: 10.1007/s10549-011-1576-1. Epub 2011 May 22.;Abstract Although the benefit of screening mammography for women over 69 has not been established, it is generally agreed that screening recommendations for older women should be individualized based on health status and breast cancer risk. However, statistical models to assess breast cancer risk have not been previously evaluated in this age group. In this study, the original Gail model and three more recent models that include mammographic breast density as a risk factor were applied to a cohort of 19,779 Vermont women aged 70 and older. Women were followed for an average of 7.1 years and 821 developed breast cancer. The predictive accuracy of each risk model was measured by its c-statistic and associations between individual risk factors and breast cancer risk were assessed by Cox regression. C-statistics were 0.54 (95% CI = 0.52-0.56) for the Gail model, 0.54 (95% CI = 0.51-0.56) for the Tice modification of the Gail model, 0.55 (95% CI = 0.53-0.58) for a model developed by Barlow and 0.55 (95% CI = 0.53-0.58) for a Vermont model. These results indicate that the models are not useful for assessing risk in women aged 70 and older. Several risk factors in the models were not significantly associated with outcome in the cohort, while others were significantly related to outcome but had smaller relative risks than estimated by the models. Age-related attenuation of the effects of some risk factors makes the prediction of breast cancer in older women particularly difficult.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Breast Neoplasms/pathology,Cohort Studies,Female,Humans,Incidence,Models, Statistical,Prevalence,Risk Assessment,Risk Factors;21604157;

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 352 positive screening mammograms of women participating in the Dutch screening programme (Nijmegen region, 2006-2008). The following mammographic findings were assessed by consensus reading of three expert radiologists: masses and mass density, calcifications, architectural distortion, focal asymmetry and mammographic density, and BI-RADS. Data on age, diagnostic workup and final diagnosis were collected from patient records. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to build a breast cancer prediction model, presented as a nomogram. RESULTS: Breast cancer was diagnosed in 108 cases (31 %). The highest positive predictive value (PPV) was found for spiculated masses (96 %) and the lowest for well-defined masses (10 %). Characteristics included in the nomogram are age, mass, calcifications, architectural distortion and focal asymmetry. CONCLUSION: With our nomogram we developed a tool assisting screening radiologists in determining the chance of malignancy based on mammographic findings. We propose cutoff values for assigning BI-RADS in the Dutch programme based on our nomogram, which will need to be validated in future research. These values can easily be adapted for use in other screening programmes. KEY POINTS: ¢?÷ There is substantial reader variability in assigning BI-RADS in mammographic screening. ¢?÷ There are no strict guidelines linking mammographic findings to BI-RADS categories. ¢?÷ We developed a model (nomogram) predicting the presence of breast cancer. ¢?÷ Our nomogram is based on common findings on positive screening mammograms. ¢?÷ The nomogram aims to assist screening radiologists in assigning BI-RADS categories.;Age Factors,Aged,Algorithms,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Decision Support Techniques,Female,Humans,Mammography/methods*,Mass Screening/methods,Middle Aged,Multivariate Analysis,Netherlands,Nomograms,Observer Variation,Odds Ratio,Predictive Value of Tests,Probability,ROC Curve,Reproducibility of Results,Retrospective Studies;23591619;

Breast cancer: computer simulation method for estimating optimal intervals for screening.;;Radiology. 1999 Aug.212(2):551-60.;Abstract PURPOSE: To develop and evaluate a mathematic method that can be used to determine the optimal screening interval for detection of breast cancer prior to distant metastatic spread. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A computer simulation was developed with the use of biologically based data from the literature on the rates of tumor growth and spread, which can be used to calculate the course of breast cancer growth and metastasis. RESULTS: On the basis of the data available at this time, the results of the simulations suggested that a screening interval of 2 years would result in a 22% reduction in the rate of distant metastatic disease, an interval of 1 year would result in a 51% reduction, and an interval of 6 months would result in an 80% reduction. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that more frequent screening could dramatically reduce the death rate from breast cancer.;Appointments and Schedules,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology,Breast Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Computer Simulation*,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Female,Humans,Incidence,Mammography*/statistics & numerical data,Mammography*/utilization,Mass Screening*/statistics & numerical data,Middle Aged,Models, Theoretical,Neoplasm Metastasis,Probability,Time Factors;10429717;
Building a model to determine the cost-effectiveness of breast cancer screening in France.;Arveux P1, Wait S, Schaffer P.;Eur J Cancer Care (Engl). 2003 Jun.12(2):143-53.;Abstract This paper describes the methods and initial validation of a cost-effectiveness model developed to simulate the breast cancer screening situation in France. The first screening pilot programmes were set up in France in 1989 to test the feasibility of a decentralized screening model based in a large number of existing non-dedicated radiology centres. The present cost-effectiveness model was built as a tool to help guide current policy discussions on the future of screening in France. This Markov model compares the costs and effects expected when a screening programme is offered to a given cohort of women to those expected in the absence of screening. The model was initially validated using current results from the Bas-Rhin screening programme and local cancer registry epidemiological data. Over a 20-year period, 315 274 women would attend for screening, of whom 12 491 would be recalled for further assessment. 4423 cancers would be detected, resulting in 637 deaths. Screening allows the detection of 106 additional cancer cases, thereby preventing 92 deaths, and saves 1522 life-years compared with a situation without screening. Breast cancer mortality is reduced by 12.6%, yielding a cost-effectiveness ratio of 137 000 FF per life-year saved. The results of initial analyses suggest that the model is capable of suitably assessing the impact of breast cancer screening in terms of costs and effects. Further scenario analyses are needed to understand the impact of screening policy changes on the costs and effectiveness of future screening programmes.;Validation Studies,Aged,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Cohort Studies,Costs and Cost Analysis,Female,France,Humans,Mass Screening/economics*,Middle Aged,Models, Economic;12787012;
Can Streamlined Multicriteria Decision Analysis Be Used to Implement Shared Decision Making for Colorectal Cancer Screening?;Dolan JG1, Boohaker E2, Allison J3, Imperiale TF4.;Med Decis Making. 2014 Aug.34(6):746-55. doi: 10.1177/0272989X13513338. Epub 2013 Dec 3.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Current US colorectal cancer screening guidelines that call for shared decision making regarding the choice among several recommended screening options are difficult to implement. Multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) is an established method well suited for supporting shared decision making. Our study goal was to determine whether a streamlined form of MCDA using rank-order-based judgments can accurately assess patients' colorectal cancer screening priorities. METHODS: We converted priorities for 4 decision criteria and 3 subcriteria regarding colorectal cancer screening obtained from 484 average-risk patients using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) in a prior study into rank-order-based priorities using rank order centroids. We compared the 2 sets of priorities using Spearman rank correlation and nonparametric Bland-Altman limits of agreement analysis. We assessed the differential impact of using the rank-order-based versus the AHP-based priorities on the results of a full MCDA comparing 3 currently recommended colorectal cancer screening strategies. Generalizability of the results was assessed using Monte Carlo simulation. RESULTS: Correlations between the 2 sets of priorities for the 7 criteria ranged from 0.55 to 0.92. The proportions of differences between rank-order-based and AHP-based priorities that were more than ‚?0.15 ranged from 1% to 16%. Differences in the full MCDA results were minimal, and the relative rankings of the 3 screening options were identical more than 88% of the time. The Monte Carlo simulation results were similar. CONCLUSIONS: Rank-order-based MCDA could be a simple, practical way to guide individual decisions and assess population decision priorities regarding colorectal cancer screening strategies. Additional research is warranted to further explore the use of these methods for promoting shared decision making. ‚?

Colorectal cancer screening in Australia: an economic evaluation of a potential biennial screening program using faecal occult blood tests.;Stone CA1, Carter RC, Vos T, John JS.;Aust N Z J Public Health. 2004 Jun.28(3):273-82.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether the introduction of a national, co-ordinated screening program using the faecal occult blood test represents 'value-for-money' from the perspective of the Australian Government as third-party funder. METHODS: The annual equivalent costs and consequences of a biennial screening program in 'steady-state' operation were estimated for the Australian population using 1996 as the reference year. Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and the years of life lost (YLLs) averted, and the health service costs were modelled, based on the epidemiology and the costs of colorectal cancer in Australia together with the mortality reduction achieved in randomised controlled trials. Uncertainty in the model was examined using Monte Carlo simulation methods. RESULTS: We estimate a minimum or 'base program' of screening those aged 55 to 69 years could avert 250 deaths per annum (95% uncertainty interval 99-400), at a gross cost of dollarsA55 million (95% UI dollarsA46 million to dollarsA96 million) and a gross incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of dollarsA17,000/DALY (95% UI dollarsA13,000/DALY to dollarsA52,000/DALY). Extending the program to include 70 to 74-year-olds is a more effective option (cheaper and higher health gain) than including the 50 to 54-year-olds. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study support the case for a national program directed at the 55 to 69-year-old age group with extension to 70 to 74-year-olds if there are sufficient resources. The pilot tests recently announced in Australia provide an important opportunity to consider the age range for screening and the sources of uncertainty, identified in the modelled evaluation, to assist decisions on implementing a full national program.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Australia/epidemiology,Colorectal Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Colorectal Neoplasms/epidemiology,Humans,Mass Screening/economics,Mass Screening/standards*,Mass Screening/utilization,Occult Blood*,Sensitivity and Specificity;15707175;
Colorectal cancer screening using fecal occult blood test and subsequent risk of colorectal cancer: a prospective cohort study in Japan.;Lee KJ1, Inoue M, Otani T, Iwasaki M, Sasazuki S, Tsugane S. Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study.;Cancer Detect Prev. 2007.31(1):3-11. Epub 2007 Feb 7.;Abstract BACKGROUND: To investigate prospectively the association between colorectal cancer screening and subsequent risk of colorectal cancer death in a large-scale population-based cohort study (the JPHC study) with a 13-year follow-up period in Japan. METHODS: We analyzed data from a population-based cohort of 42,150 (20,326 men and 21,824 women) subjects. Subjects who had undergone fecal occult blood test (FOBT) screening during the preceding 12 months were defined as the screened group. A total of 132 colorectal cancer deaths and 597 cases of newly diagnosed colorectal cancer were identified during the follow-up period. RESULTS: We observed a nearly 70% decrease in colorectal cancer mortality in screened versus unscreened subjects (RR=0.28, 95% CI=0.13-0.61). Screening participation was associated with a 30% reduced risk of death from all causes other than colorectal cancer (RR=0.70, 95% CI=0.61-0.79). However, the extent of mortality reduction was greater for colorectal cancer than other causes. A significant decrease in the incidence of advanced colorectal cancer was seen in screened subjects (RR=0.41, 95% CI=0.27-0.63), although the overall incidence rate did not differ significantly between the screened and unscreened groups. CONCLUSION: Although self-selection bias could not be fully controlled, these findings suggest that colorectal cancer screening may be associated with a reduction in mortality from colorectal cancer in the Japanese population.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Age Factors,Colorectal Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Colorectal Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Confounding Factors (Epidemiology),Female,Follow-Up Studies,Humans,Incidence,Japan/epidemiology,Male,Mass Screening*,Middle Aged,Occult Blood*,Population Surveillance,Proportional Hazards Models,Prospective Studies,Research Design,Risk Assessment,Risk Factors,Sex Factors,Surveys and Questionnaires,Survival Analysis;17289293;
Colorectal cancer screening with faecal occult blood test within a multiple disease screening programme: an experience from Keelung, Taiwan.;;J Med Screen. 2006.13 Suppl 1:S8-13.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Given increasing rates of colorectal cancer (CRC) in countries with intermediate incidence rates, the decision to implement population-based screening must consider the trade-off between high costs and a relatively low yield. In Taiwan, we proposed community-based CRC screening using faecal occult blood tests (FOBT) within a multiple disease screening programme. AIMS: Based on early results from the screening programme, we aimed to compare the projected efficacies, in terms of reductions in CRC mortality, achieved with multiple disease screening, single disease screening and no screening programmes. METHODS: Annual FOBT has been included in the Keelung multiple disease screening programme. A total of 26,008 subjects were offered screening. Early indicators have been estimated to assess the potential effectiveness of this programme, including the Dukes' stage distribution of screen-detected cases, the proportionate incidence and the prevalence/incidence ratio. Transition rates according to adenoma size and Dukes' stage have been estimated from an eight-state Markov model. The projected mortality reductions based on this disease natural history have been estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation for both multiple screening and single screening. RESULTS: The overall attendance rate was 82% at the first screen and 87% at the second screen. At the first screen, 70% of screen-detected cases were localized (i.e. Dukes' stage A or B). The corresponding figure for the second screen was 80%. Approximately three-quarters of detected adenomas were smaller than 1 cm. The estimated mean transition times from diminutive adenoma to small adenoma, from small adenoma to large adenoma and from large adenoma to pre-clinical Dukes' A or B invasive carcinoma were 14.4, 5.4 and 5.6 years, respectively. Estimated reductions in CRC mortality, based on annual screening, are 23 and 33% for the single and multiple disease screening programmes, respectively. Multiple screening with an annual screening regime may lead to a further 13% reduction in mortality when compared to conventional single screening. CONCLUSION: Early indications suggest that population-based screening for CRC with FOBT, implemented through a multi-disease screening programme, is both feasible and efficacious. Further evaluation of the programme, through longer follow-up and cost-effectiveness analysis, is now required.;Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Colorectal Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Colorectal Neoplasms/prevention & control,Humans,Markov Chains,Mass Screening/methods*,Mass Screening/statistics & numerical data,Middle Aged,Occult Blood*,Risk Factors,Taiwan;17227635;
Colorectal cancer screening: advice from the Health Council of the Netherlands].;van Veen W1, Mali WP.;Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd. 2009.153:A1441.;Abstract There is sufficient evidence that a colorectal cancer (CRC) screening programme is feasible, acceptable and cost-effective amongst the Dutch population. This is the conclusion of the Health Council of the Netherlands in an advisory report to the Minister of Health, Welfare and Sport. It also concluded that an immunochemical faecal occult blood test (iFOBT) would be the obvious screening method. The recommended target group is men and women aged 55-75. An evaluation of the randomized pilot trials in the regions of Nijmegen, Amsterdam, and Rotterdam predicted a participation rate of 60%. Based on the analyses from a microsimulation model, biennial screening for CRC with iFOBT and an uptake rate of 60% could prevent 1400 deaths from CRC per annum, at a cost of 2200 euros per years of life saved.;English Abstract,Aged,Colorectal Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Colorectal Neoplasms/economics,Colorectal Neoplasms/mortality,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Female,Humans,Male,Mass Screening/economics*,Mass Screening/methods*,Middle Aged,Netherlands,Occult Blood*,Sensitivity and Specificity;20003552;

Comparative Effectiveness and Cost Effectiveness of a Multitarget Stool DNA Test to Screen for Colorectal Neoplasia.;;Gastroenterology. 2016 Sep.151(3):427-439.e6. doi: 10.1053/j.gastro.2016.06.003. Epub 2016 Jun 14.;Abstract BACKGROUND & AIMS: We developed a model to determine whether a multitarget stool DNA (MT-sDNA) test that detects colorectal cancer (CRC) and polyps with higher sensitivity and lower specificity, but at a higher cost, than the fecal immunochemical test (FIT) can be used in screening. METHODS: We used a Markov model of average-risk CRC screening to compare the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of screening with the MT-sDNA test vs FIT or colonoscopy. We accounted for the complex longitudinal participation patterns observed in organized programs vs opportunistic screening, as well as organized programs' patient support costs and differential payment rates by commercial insurers vs Medicare. RESULTS: With optimal adherence, yearly FIT and colonoscopy every 10 years were dominant (more effective and less costly) than MT-sDNA every 3 years. Compared with successful organized FIT programs (50% consistent and 27% intermittent participation. patient support costs, $153/cycle), the patient support program for the MT-sDNA test would need 68% of subjects to participate consistently and 32% to participate intermittently every 3 years, or the MT-sDNA test would need to cost 60% less than in the base case ($260 commercial payment and $197 Medicare payment), for the MT-sDNA test to be preferred over FIT at a threshold of $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Compared with opportunistic yearly FIT screening (15% consistent and 30% intermittent participation), performing the MT-sDNA test every 3 years would cost less than $100,000 per QALY gained if the MT-sDNA test achieved a participation rate more than 1.7-fold that of FIT. The results were robust in sensitivity analyses. Assuming equal participation across strategies and a threshold of $100,000 per QALY gained, FIT was preferred in 99.3% of iterations in Monte Carlo simulation. CONCLUSIONS: In a Markov model, we found FIT and colonoscopy to be more effective and less costly than the MT-sDNA test when participation rates were equal for all strategies. For the MT-sDNA test to be cost effective, the patient support program included in its cost would need to achieve substantially higher participation rates than those of FIT, whether in organized programs or under the opportunistic screening setting that is more common in the United States than in the rest of the world.

Continuing screening mammography in women aged 70 to 79 years: impact on life expectancy and cost-effectiveness.;;JAMA. 1999 Dec 8.282(22):2156-63.;Abstract CONTEXT: Mammography is recommended and is cost-effective for women aged 50 to 69 years, but the value of continuing screening mammography after age 69 years is not known. In particular, older women with low bone mineral density (BMD) have a lower risk of breast cancer and may benefit less from continued screening. OBJECTIVE: To compare life expectancy and cost-effectiveness of screening mammography in elderly women based on 3 screening strategies. DESIGN: Decision analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov model. PATIENTS: General population of women aged 65 years or older. INTERVENTIONS: The analysis compared 3 strategies: (1) Undergoing biennial mammography from age 65 to 69 years. (2) undergoing biennial mammography from age 65 to 69 years, measurement of distal radial BMD at age 65 years, discontinuing screening at age 69 years in women in the lowest BMD quartile for age, and continuing biennial mammography to age 79 years in those in the top 3 quartiles of distal radius BMD. and (3) undergoing biennial mammography from age 65 to 79 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Deaths due to breast cancer averted, life expectancy, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: Compared with discontinuing mammography screening at age 69 years, measuring BMD at age 65 years in 10000 women and continuing mammography to age 79 years only in women with BMD in the top 3 quartiles would prevent 9.4 deaths and add, on average, 2.1 days to life expectancy at an incremental cost of $66773 per year of life saved. Continuing mammography to age 79 years in all 10000 elderly women would prevent 1.4 additional breast cancer deaths and add only 7.2 hours to life expectancy at an incremental cost of $117689 per year of life saved compared with only continuing mammography to age 79 years in women with BMD in the top 3 quartiles. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis suggests that continuing mammography screening after age 69 years results in a small gain in life expectancy and is moderately cost-effective in those with high BMD and more costly in those with low BMD. Women's preferences for a small gain in life expectancy and the potential harms of screening mammography should play an important role when elderly women are deciding about screening.;Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Bone Density,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology,Breast Neoplasms/prevention & control,Carcinoma in Situ/epidemiology,Carcinoma in Situ/prevention & control,Carcinoma, Ductal, Breast/epidemiology,Carcinoma, Ductal, Breast/prevention & control,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Decision Support Techniques,Female,Humans,Life Expectancy*,Mammography/economics*,Mammography/statistics & numerical data*,Markov Chains,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,Sensitivity and Specificity,1 U01 CA 63740/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,P50 CA58207/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;10591338;

Cost effectiveness of CT colonography for UK NHS colorectal cancer screening of asymptomatic adults aged 60-69 years.;;Appl Health Econ Health Policy. 2010.8(3):141-54. doi: 10.2165/11535650-000000000-00000.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Screening of populations at risk for colorectal cancer (CRC) allows the detection and successful treatment of tumours and their precursor polyps. The current UK CRC screening programme is faecal occult blood testing (FOBT), despite evidence from modelling studies to suggest that more cost-effective technologies exist. OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost effectiveness of CT colonography (CTC) for colorectal cancer screening from the perspective of the UK NHS. METHODS: A state-transition Markov model was constructed to estimate lifetime costs and health outcomes of a cohort of individuals screened at age 60-69 years using four different CRC screening technologies: FOBT, flexible sigmoidoscopy, optical colonoscopy and CTC. RESULTS: CTC screening offered every 10 years was cost saving compared with the current UK programme of biennial FOBT screening. This strategy also yielded greater health benefits (QALYs and life-years) than biennial FOBT screening. The model fit observed CRC epidemiology data well and was robust to changes in underlying parameter values. CTC remained cost effective under a range of assumptions in the univariate sensitivity analysis. However, in the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, CTC dominated FOBT in only 5.9% of simulations and was cost effective at a threshold of pound30,000 per QALY gained in 48% of simulations. CONCLUSIONS: CTC has the potential to provide a cost-effective option for CRC screening in the UK NHS and may be cost saving compared with the current programme of biennial FOBT. Further analysis is required to assess the impact of introducing CTC to the UK CRC screening programme on the NHS budget and capacity.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Aged,Colonography, Computed Tomographic/economics*,Colorectal Neoplasms/economics*,Colorectal Neoplasms/prevention & control,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Female,Humans,Male,Markov Chains,Mass Screening/economics*,Middle Aged,Occult Blood,Quality-Adjusted Life Years*,Sensitivity and Specificity,State Medicine/economics*,United Kingdom;20369905;
Cost effectiveness of mammography screening for Chinese women.;Wong IO1, Kuntz KM, Cowling BJ, Lam CL, Leung GM.;Cancer. 2007 Aug 15.110(4):885-95.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Although the cost effectiveness of screening mammography in most western developed populations has been accepted, it may not apply to Chinese women, who have a much lower breast cancer incidence. The authors estimated the cost effectiveness of biennial mammography in Hong Kong Chinese women to inform evidence-based screening policies. METHODS: For the current study, a state-transition Markov model was developed to simulate mammography screening, breast cancer diagnosis, and treatment in a hypothetical cohort of Chinese women. The benefit of mammography was modeled by assuming a stage shift, in which cancers in screened women were more likely to be diagnosed at an earlier disease stage. The authors compared costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) saved, and life years saved (LYS) for 5 screening strategies. RESULTS: Biennial screening resulted in a gain in life expectancy ranging from 4.3 days to 9.4 days compared with no screening at an incremental cost of from US $1,166 to US $2,425 per woman. The least costly, nondominated screening option was screening from ages 40 years to 69 years, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of US $61,600 per QALY saved or US $64,400 per LYS compared with no screening. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, the probability of the ICER being below a threshold of US $50,000 per QALY (LYS) was 15.3% (14.6%). CONCLUSIONS: The current results suggested that mammography for Hong Kong Chinese women currently may not be cost effective based on the arbitrary threshold of US $50,000 per QALY. However, clinicians must remain vigilant and periodically should revisit the question of population screening: Disease rates in China have been increasing because of westernization and socioeconomic development.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Age Factors,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Asian Continental Ancestry Group/statistics & numerical data*,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/economics,Breast Neoplasms/ethnology,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Female,Hong Kong/epidemiology,Humans,Incidence,Mammography/economics*,Markov Chains,Mass Screening/economics*,Mass Screening/methods,Middle Aged,Models, Theoretical;17607668;
Cost effectiveness of shortening screening interval or extending age range of NHS breast screening programme: computer simulation study.;;BMJ. 1998 Aug 8.317(7155):376-9.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost effectiveness of two possible modifications to the current UK screening programme: shortening the screening interval from three to two years and extending the age of invitation to a final screen from 64 to 69. DESIGN: Computer simulation model which first simulates life histories for women in the absence of a screening programme for breast cancer and then assesses how these life histories would be changed by introducing different screening policies. The model was informed by screening and cost data from the NHS breast screening programme. SETTING: North West region of England. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Numbers of deaths prevented, life years gained, and costs. RESULTS: Compared with the current breast screening programme both modifications would increase the number of deaths prevented and the number of life years saved. The current screening policy costs 2522 pounds per life year gained. extending the age range of the programme would cost 2612 pounds and shortening the interval 2709 pounds per life year gained. The marginal cost per life year gained of extending the age range of the screening programme is 2990 pounds and of shortening the screening interval is 3545 pounds. CONCLUSIONS: If the budget for the NHS breast screening programme were to allow for two more invitations per woman, substantial mortality reductions would follow from extending the age range screened or reducing the screening interval.

In order to determine the overall impact of mammography screening, activity data collected from the second screening round (1996-1997) were compared with expected activity levels in the case no screening had taken place in this time period. The direct health care costs associated with the screening activity, excluding effects on treatment and diagnostics but including women's transport and time costs, were estimated at DKK 305 per attendee. The cost of clinical mammography decreases with the introduction of screening due to a decrease in the total number of women undergoing this introductory diagnostic activity, while surgery costs increases, whereas cost incurred by adjuvant treatment and treatment of recurrences will be significantly reduced. Overall, inclusion of effects on course of treatment decreases the net cost of screening by 30-40% to DKK 208 and DKK 128 including and excluding the women's time and transport costs, respectively.

Cost of the cervical cancer screening program at the Mexican Social Security Institute;Granados-Garcia V., Flores Y.N., Perez R., Rudolph S.E., Lazcano-Ponce E., Salmeron J.;2014,Salud Publica de Mexico;Objective: To estimate the annual cost of the National Cervical Cancer Screening Program (CCSP) of the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS). Materials and methods. This cost analysis examined regional coverage rates reported by IMSS. We estimated the number of cytology, colposcopy, biopsy and pathology evaluations, as well as the diagnostic test and treatment costs for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade II and III (CIN 2/3) and cervical cancer. Diagnostic test costs were estimated using a micro-costing technique. Sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: The cost to perform 2.7 million cytology tests was nearly 38 million dollars, which represents 26.1% of the total program cost (145.4 million). False negatives account for nearly 43% of the program costs. Conclusion: The low sensitivity of the cytology test generates high rates of false negatives, which results in high institutional costs from the treatment of undetected cervical cancer cases.;Cervical cancer, Costs and cost analysis, Cytology, Mexico, Screening;;

Cost-effectiveness analyses in gynecologic oncology: methodological quality and trends.;Manuel MR1, Chen LM, Caughey AB, Subak LL.;Gynecol Oncol. 2004 Apr.93(1):1-8.;Abstract OBJECTIVES: To evaluate methodological quality and trends of cost-effectiveness analyses (CEA) published in gynecologic oncology. METHODS: A medical literature search of articles from 1966 through 2002 was performed to identify original, English-language articles that included economic analyses in gynecologic oncology. We included articles that were cost-effectiveness or cost-benefit analyses or performed these analyses as part of their study. Ten methodological principles that should be incorporated in CEAs were assessed for each study. Each article was given a score of 0, 1, or 2 for each of the 10 methodological principles (max score = 20). Data were analyzed using the Student t test, ANOVA, and linear regression. RESULTS: We screened 693 articles to identify 68 that met our inclusion criteria. The articles focused on cervical cancer (n = 53. 78%), ovarian cancer (n = 11. 16%), uterine cancer (n = 2. 3%), and general perioperative care (n = 2. 3%). The mean (+/-SD) methodological principle score was 16.1 (+/-4.1) and we observed a significant improvement in the total score over time (P = 0.01). Primary CEA's (CEA identified as the objective of the study) were of higher quality than secondary CEA's (primary objective of the study was not CEA but CEA was included in the study. total scores 18.2 vs. 11.6, respectively. P<0.0001). Studies with at least one investigator in public health or healthcare economies also had higher quality (mean total score 17.7 vs. 15.2. P=0.006). The most common limitations of published CEAs were in methodology or presentation of incremental analyses, sensitivity analyses, and discounting. CONCLUSIONS: Cost-effectiveness analyses in gynecologic oncology showed significant improvement in quality over the last two decades. Despite this progress, methodological improvement is still needed in the areas of incremental comparisons and sensitivity analysis. Understanding the methodology of cost-effectiveness analysis is critical for researchers, editors, and readers to accurately interpret results of the growing body of CEA articles.;Meta-Analysis,Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.,Analysis of Variance,Cost-Benefit Analysis/methods,Cost-Benefit Analysis/standards*,Cost-Benefit Analysis/trends,Female,Gynecology/economics*,Humans,Linear Models,Medical Oncology/economics*,K12 HD01262-02/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States;15047206;
Cost-effectiveness analysis of anal cancer screening in women with cervical neoplasia in British Columbia, Canada.;Cromwell I1,2, Gaudet M3,4, Peacock SJ5,6,7, Aquino-Parsons C3.;BMC Health Serv Res. 2016 Jun 27.16:206. doi: 10.1186/s12913-016-1442-2.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Precursors to anal squamous cell carcinoma may be detectable through screening. however, the literature suggests that population-level testing is not cost-effective. Given that high-grade cervical neoplasia (CIN) is associated with an increased risk of developing anal cancer, and in light of changing guidelines for the follow-up and management of cervical neoplasia, it is worthwhile to examine the costs and effectiveness of an anal cancer screening program delivered to women with previously-detected CIN. METHODS: A model of anal cancer screening and treatment was constructed, to estimate the cost-effectiveness of a population of CIN II/III+ women who were screened using anal cytology vs. one that received no anal cancer screening. Costs were based on Canadian estimates, and survival was based on estimates taken from the scientific literature. Effectiveness was measured in terms of life years gained (LYG) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The model was run for 50 cycles, with each cycle representing one year. RESULTS: Incremental cost (screened vs. unscreened) was $82.17 per woman in the model. Incremental effectiveness was 0.004 LYG, and was equivalent to zero in terms of QALY. An ICER of $20,561/LYG was calculated, while no meaningful incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) could be calculated for quality-adjusted survival. CONCLUSION: Our analysis suggests that anal cancer screening is cost-effective in terms of overall survival in women with a previous diagnosis of CIN II or CIN III as part of regular follow-up, but may not contribute meaningfully-different quality-adjusted survival due to the adverse effects of screening-related interventions.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Anus Neoplasms/diagnosis*,British Columbia,Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/diagnosis*,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Early Detection of Cancer/economics*,Female,Health Care Costs,Humans,Models, Statistical,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/complications*;27349646;
Cost-effectiveness analysis of cervical cancer screening strategies based on the Papanicolaou smear test in Korea.;Ko MJ1, Kim J, Kim Y, Lee YJ, Hong SR, Lee JK.;Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2015.16(6):2317-22.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Despite the increasing number of screening examinations performed for cervical cancer utilizing the Papanicolaou smear test (Pap test), few studies have examined whether this strategy is cost-effective in Korea. OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of cervical cancer screening strategies incorporating the Pap test based on age at the start and end of screening as well as screening interval. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We designed four alternative screening strategies based on patient age when screening was started (20 or 30 years) and discontinued (lifetime, 79 years). Each strategy was assessed at screening intervals of 1, 2, 3, or 5 years. A Markov model was developed to determine the cost-effectiveness of the 16 possible cervical cancer screening strategies, and this was evaluated from a societal perspective. The main outcome measures were average lifetime cost, incremental quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: Compared with various strategies comprising younger starting age, discontinuation age, and longer screening intervals, strategies employing annual screening for cervical cancer starting at a target age of 30 years and above were the most cost-effective, with an ICER of 21,012.98 dollars per QALY gained (with a Korean threshold of 30,000,000 KRW or US$27,272). CONCLUSIONS: We found that annual screening for cervical cancer beginning at a target age of 30 years and above is most cost-effective screening strategy. Considering the potential economic advantages, more intense screening policies for cervical cancer might be favorable among countries with high rates of cervical cancer and relatively low screening costs.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Aged,Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/diagnosis,Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/economics*,Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/virology,Cost-Benefit Analysis*,Early Detection of Cancer/economics*,Female,Follow-Up Studies,Humans,Middle Aged,Models, Theoretical,Neoplasm Grading,Neoplasm Staging,Papanicolaou Test/economics*,Papillomaviridae/isolation & purification,Papillomavirus Infections/diagnosis,Papillomavirus Infections/economics*,Papillomavirus Infections/virology,Prognosis,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,Republic of Korea,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/economics*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/virology,Vaginal Smears/economics*,Young Adult;25824757;
Cost-effectiveness analysis of colorectal cancer screening strategies in Singapore: a dynamic decision analytic approach.;Wong SS1, Leong AP, Leong TY.;Stud Health Technol Inform. 2004.107(Pt 1):104-10.;Abstract A dynamic decision analytic framework using local statistics and expert's opinions is put to study the cost-effectiveness of colorectal cancer screening strategies in Singapore. It is demonstrated that any of the screening strategies, if implemented, would increase the life expectancy of the population of 50 to 70 years old. The model also determined the normal life expectancy of this population to be 76.32 years. Overall, Guaiac Fecal Occult Blood Test (FOBT) is most cost effective at SGD162.11 per life year saved per person. Our approach allowed us to model problem parameters that change over time and study the utility measures like cost and life expectancy for specific age within the range of 50- 69 through to 70 years old.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Aged,Barium Sulfate,Colonoscopy/economics,Colorectal Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Colorectal Neoplasms/economics,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Decision Support Techniques*,Enema/economics,Female,Humans,Life Expectancy,Male,Markov Chains,Mass Screening/economics*,Middle Aged,Occult Blood,Sigmoidoscopy/economics,Singapore,Barium Sulfate;15360784;
Cost-effectiveness analysis of fecal occult blood screening for colorectal cancer.;Lejeune C1, Arveux P, Dancourt V, Bƒ?jean S, Bonithon-Kopp C, Faivre J.;Int J Technol Assess Health Care. 2004 Fall.20(4):434-9.;Abstract OBJECTIVES: Clinical trials have demonstrated that fecal occult blood screening for colorectal cancer can significantly reduce mortality. However, to be deemed a priority from a public health policy perspective, any new program must prove itself to be cost-effective. The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of screening for colorectal cancer using a fecal occult blood screening test, the Hemoccult-II, in a cohort of 100,000 asymptomatic individuals 50-74 years of age. METHODS: A decision analysis model using a Markov approach simulates the trajectory of the cohort allocated either to screening or no screening over a 20-year period through several health states. Clinical and economic data used in the model came from the Burgundy trial, French population-based studies, and Registry data. RESULTS: Modeling biennial screening versus the absence of screening over a 20-year period resulted in a 17.7 percent mortality reduction and a discounted incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 3357 Euro per life-year gained among individuals 50-74 years of age. Sensitivity analyses performed on epidemiological and economic data showed the strong impact on the results of colonoscopy cost, of compliance to screening, and of specificity of the screening test. CONCLUSIONS: Cost-effectiveness estimates and sensitivity analyses suggest that biennial screening for colorectal cancer with fecal occult blood test could be recommended from the age of 50 until 74. Our findings support the attempts to introduce large-scale population screening programs.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Aged,Colorectal Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Colorectal Neoplasms/epidemiology,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Humans,Markov Chains,Mass Screening/economics*,Middle Aged,Occult Blood*;15609792;

Cost-effectiveness analysis of screening strategies for colorectal cancer in Colombia [Analisis de Costo-Efectividad de las Estrategias de Tamizacion de Cancer Colorrectal en Colombia];Pinzon Florez C.E., Rosselli D., Gamboa Garay O.A.;2012,Value in Health Regional Issues;Objective: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different screening strategies for colorectal cancer in Colombia. Methods: We designed a Markov model to compare the clinical and economic impact in terms of reducing the incidence and mortality from colorectal cancer (CRC). Six screening strategies for adults were compared: fecal occult blood (FOBT) immunochemical and guaiac type, conventional colonoscopy, flexible sigmoidoscopy, and FOBT guaiac and immunochemical type more sigmoidoscopy. We used the third-party payer perspective, including only direct costs, the time horizon was the life expectancy of the Colombian population. We estimated cost-effectiveness ratios (CERs) and incremental cost-effectiveness (ICER). Were performed deterministic sensitivity analysis and probabilistic. We applied a discount rate of 3% in the costs and health outcomes. Results: The screening strategy more cost-effective was the FOBT biennial guaiac type. The cost per life year gained was US$10,347.37, US$18,380.64, and US$45,158.05. For FOBT guaiac biennial, FOBT guaiac annual and FOBT inmunoquimica biennial respectively. The ICER is sensitive to the percentage of false positive test for FOBT guaiac type values greater than 10%, and the cost of the test. Conclusions: The screening strategy more cost-effective for Colombia is the FOBT biennial guaiac type, using as a threshold the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in Colombia. ? 2012 International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR).;,article, cancer screening, Colombia, colonoscopy, colorectal cancer, cost effectiveness analysis, false positive result, fecal occult blood test guaiac type, fecal occult blood test immunochemical type, occult blood test, priority journal, sigmoidoscopy, statistical model;;

AIM: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of FOBT, FS and colonoscopy on the basis of disease prevalence, compliance rate and cost of screening procedures in Asian countries. METHODS: A hypothetical population of 100 000 persons aged 50 undergoes either FOBT annually, FS every 5 years or colonoscopy every 10 years until the age of 80 years. Patients with positive FOBT or polyp in FS are offered colonoscopy. Surveillance colonoscopy is repeated every 3 years. The treatment cost of CRC, including surgery and chemotherapy, was evaluated. A Markov model was used to compare the cost-effectiveness of different screening strategies. RESULTS: Assuming a compliance rate of 90%, colonoscopy, FS and FOBT can reduce CRC incidence by 54.1%, 37.1% and 29.3% respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for FOBT (US$6222 per life-year saved) is lower than FS (US$8044 per life-year saved) and colonoscopy (US$7211 per life-year saved). When the compliance rate drops to 50% and 30%, FOBT still has the lowest ICER.

Cost-effectiveness analysis on the once-in-a-lifetime cervical cancer screening program for women living in rural and urban areas of China].;;Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi. 2013 Apr.34(4):399-403.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of once-in-a-lifetime cervical cancer screening program and to predict the optimal modality for its operation on women living in rural and urban areas of China, based on Markov modeling and simulation. METHODS: Three modalities including visual inspection with acetic acid plus Lugol's iodine (VIA/VILI), conventional Pap Smear (Pap Smear), and simple HPV DNA testing (careHPV) were hypothesized for the rural cohort, whereas other five modalities including Pap Smear, liquid-based cytology (LBC), simple HPV DNA testing (careHPV), Hybrid Capture 2 HPV DNA testing (HC2), and LBC plus HC2 (LBC + HC2) were tested for the urban cohort. A Markov model was constructed based on the factors as natural history, screening, diagnosis and treatment on cervical cancer using data related to the epidemics and the costs from rural and urban areas of the country. Long-term effectiveness and cost-effectiveness were predicted through simulation of the model. RESULTS: Compared to the non-screening scenario, the amount of life years saved were 277.97 - 2727.53 and 134.02 - 1446.84 years per 100 000 women, respectively, for different cohorts in rural and urban areas. The cost-effectiveness ratios were 1520.99 - 2453.74 and 3847.35 - 44 570.35 RMB per life year saved, respectively, for different cohorts in rural and urban areas. The incremental cost-effective ratio for careHPV starting from 40 years old (careHPV@40) and careHPV from 30 years old (careHPV@30) dominated other strategies for the rural cohort, while careHPV@40, careHPV@30, HC2 from 30 years old (HC2@30), and LBC + HC2 from 30 years old (LBC + HC2@30) were dominant for the urban cohort. CONCLUSION: All eight once-in-a-lifetime cervical cancer screening modalities were cost-effective based on our model. In particular, careHPV screening starting from 40 years old seemed to be the most cost-effective one for women living in both rural and urban areas.;English Abstract,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Age Factors,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Early Detection of Cancer,Female,Humans,Mass Screening/economics*,Middle Aged,Outcome and Process Assessment (Health Care),Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*;23937850;

Cost-effectiveness and budget impact analysis of a population-based screening program for colorectal cancer.;Pil L1, Fobelets M2, Putman K3, Trybou J4, Annemans L5.;Eur J Intern Med. 2016 Jul.32:72-8. doi: 10.1016/j.ejim.2016.03.031. Epub 2016 May 3.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer mortality in Belgium. In Flanders (Belgium), a population-based screening program with a biennial immunochemical faecal occult blood test (iFOBT) in women and men aged 56-74 has been organised since 2013. This study assessed the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of the colorectal population-based screening program in Flanders (Belgium). METHODS: A health economic model was conducted, consisting of a decision tree simulating the screening process and a Markov model, with a time horizon of 20years, simulating natural progression. Predicted mortality and incidence, total costs, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) with and without the screening program were calculated in order to determine the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of CRC screening. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted, taking into account uncertainty of the model parameters. RESULTS: Mortality and incidence were predicted to decrease over 20years. The colorectal screening program in Flanders is found to be cost-effective with an ICER of 1681/QALY (95% CI -1317 to 6601) in males and ¢??4,484/QALY (95% CI -3254 to 18,163). The probability of being cost-effective given a threshold of ¢??35,000/QALY was 100% and 97.3%, respectively. The budget impact analysis showed the extra cost for the health care payer to be limited. CONCLUSION: This health economic analysis has shown that despite the possible adverse effects of screening and the extra costs for the health care payer and the patient, the population-based screening program for CRC in Flanders is cost-effective and should therefore be maintained.

Cost-effectiveness modeling of colorectal cancer: computed tomography colonography vs colonoscopy or fecal occult blood tests.;Lucidarme O1, Cadi M, Berger G, Taieb J, Poynard T, Grenier P, Beresniak A.;Eur J Radiol. 2012 Jul.81(7):1413-9. doi: 10.1016/j.ejrad.2011.03.027. Epub 2011 Mar 27.;Abstract OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of three colorectal-cancer (CRC) screening strategies in France: fecal-occult-blood tests (FOBT), computed-tomography-colonography (CTC) and optical-colonoscopy (OC). METHODS: Ten-year simulation modeling was used to assess a virtual asymptomatic, average-risk population 50-74 years old. Negative OC was repeated 10 years later, and OC positive for advanced or non-advanced adenoma 3 or 5 years later, respectively. FOBT was repeated biennially. Negative CTC was repeated 5 years later. Positive CTC and FOBT led to triennial OC. Total cost and CRC rate after 10 years for each screening strategy and 0-100% adherence rates with 10% increments were computed. Transition probabilities were programmed using distribution ranges to account for uncertainty parameters. Direct medical costs were estimated using the French national health insurance prices. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses used 5000 Monte Carlo simulations generating model outcomes and standard deviations. RESULTS: For a given adherence rate, CTC screening was always the most effective but not the most cost-effective. FOBT was the least effective but most cost-effective strategy. OC was of intermediate efficacy and the least cost-effective strategy. Without screening, treatment of 123 CRC per 10,000 individuals would cost ¢??3,444,000. For 60% adherence, the respective costs of preventing and treating, respectively 49 and 74 FOBT-detected, 73 and 50 CTC-detected and 63 and 60 OC-detected CRC would be ¢??2,810,000, ¢??6,450,000 and ¢??9,340,000. CONCLUSION: Simulation modeling helped to identify what would be the most effective (CTC) and cost-effective screening (FOBT) strategy in the setting of mass CRC screening in France.

Cost-effectiveness of alternative strategies for integrating MRI into breast cancer screening for women at high risk.;Ahern CH1, Shih YC2, Dong W3, Parmigiani G4, Shen Y3.;Br J Cancer. 2014 Oct 14.111(8):1542-51. doi: 10.1038/bjc.2014.458. Epub 2014 Aug 19.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is recommended for women at high risk for breast cancer. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of alternative screening strategies involving MRI. METHODS: Using a microsimulation model, we generated life histories under different risk profiles, and assessed the impact of screening on quality-adjusted life-years, and lifetime costs, both discounted at 3%. We compared 12 screening strategies combining annual or biennial MRI with mammography and clinical breast examination (CBE) in intervals of 0.5, 1, or 2 years vs without, and reported incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS: Based on an ICER threshold of $100,000/QALY, the most cost-effective strategy for women at 25% lifetime risk was to stagger MRI and mammography plus CBE every year from age 30 to 74, yielding ICER $58,400 (compared to biennial MRI alone). At 50% lifetime risk and with 70% reduction in MRI cost, the recommended strategy was to stagger MRI and mammography plus CBE every 6 months (ICER=$84,400). At 75% lifetime risk, the recommended strategy is biennial MRI combined with mammography plus CBE every 6 months (ICER=$62,800). CONCLUSIONS: The high costs of MRI and its lower specificity are limiting factors for annual screening schedule of MRI, except for women at sufficiently high risk.;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Adult,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Cost-Benefit Analysis*,Female,Humans,Magnetic Resonance Imaging/economics,Magnetic Resonance Imaging/utilization*,Mass Screening/economics,Mass Screening/utilization,Middle Aged,Monte Carlo Method,Risk Factors,P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,RC1 CA145799/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,R01-CA07466/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,R03HG004055/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States,R01 CA079466/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,R03 HG004055/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States,RC1CA145799/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,P30 CA125123/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,R21 CA165092/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,R21-CA165092/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,5P30 CA006516-46/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,P30 CA006516/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;25137022;

Cost-effectiveness of breast cancer screening policies using simulation.;Gocgun Y1, Banjevic D2, Taghipour S3, Montgomery N2, Harvey BJ4, Jardine AK2, Miller AB4.;Breast. 2015 Aug.24(4):440-8. doi: 10.1016/j.breast.2015.03.012. Epub 2015 Apr 10.;Abstract In this paper, we study breast cancer screening policies using computer simulation. We developed a multi-state Markov model for breast cancer progression, considering both the screening and treatment stages of breast cancer. The parameters of our model were estimated through data from the Canadian National Breast Cancer Screening Study as well as data in the relevant literature. Using computer simulation, we evaluated various screening policies to study the impact of mammography screening for age-based subpopulations in Canada. We also performed sensitivity analysis to examine the impact of certain parameters on number of deaths and total costs. The analysis comparing screening policies reveals that a policy in which women belonging to the 40-49 age group are not screened, whereas those belonging to the 50-59 and 60-69 age groups are screened once every 5 years, outperforms others with respect to cost per life saved. Our analysis also indicates that increasing the screening frequencies for the 50-59 and 60-69 age groups decrease mortality, and that the average number of deaths generally decreases with an increase in screening frequency. We found that screening annually for all age groups is associated with the highest costs per life saved. Our analysis thus reveals that cost per life saved increases with an increase in screening frequency.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Age Factors,Aged,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Canada,Computer Simulation,Cost-Benefit Analysis/methods,Cost-Benefit Analysis/statistics & numerical data*,Early Detection of Cancer/economics*,Early Detection of Cancer/mortality,Female,Humans,Mammography/economics*,Mammography/mortality,Mass Screening/economics*,Mass Screening/methods,Middle Aged,Models, Theoretical,Time Factors;25866350;
Cost-effectiveness of cervical cancer prevention in Central and Eastern Europe and Central Asia.;;Vaccine. 2013 Dec 31.31 Suppl 7:H71-9. doi: 10.1016/j.vaccine.2013.04.086.;"Abstract We studied the cost-effectiveness of cervical cancer prevention strategies in the Central and Eastern Europe and Central Asia (CEECA) region. The cost-effectiveness of human papillomavirus (HPV)16/18 vaccination of 12 year-old girls was calculated for 28 countries, under the assumption that vaccination prevents 70% of all cervical cancer cases and that cervical cancer and all-cause mortality rates are stable without vaccination. At three-dose vaccination costs of I$ 100 per vaccinated girl (currency 2005 international dollars), HPV16/18 vaccination was very cost-effective in 25 out of 28 countries using the country's gross domestic product (GDP) per capita as cost-effectiveness threshold (criterion by World Health Organization). A three-dose vaccination cost of I$ 100 is within the current range of vaccine costs in European immunization programs, and therefore our results indicate that HPV vaccination may be good value for money. To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of cervical cancer screening combined with vaccination, we calibrated a published simulation model to HPV genotype data collected in Slovenia, Poland, and Georgia. The screening interval was varied at 3, 6, and 10 years starting at age 25 or 30 and ending at age 60. In Slovenia and Poland, combined vaccination and 10-yearly HPV (DNA) screening (vaccination coverage 70%, screening coverage per round 70%) was very cost-effective when the cost of three-dose vaccination was I$ 100 per vaccinated girl. More intensive screening was very cost-effective when the screening coverage per round was 30% or 50%. In Georgia, 10-yearly Pap screening was very cost-effective in unvaccinated women. Vaccination combined with 10-yearly HPV screening was likely to be cost-effective if the three-dose vaccination cost was I$ 50 per vaccinated girl. To conclude, cervical cancer prevention strategies utilizing both HPV16/18 vaccination and HPV screening are very cost-effective in countries with sufficient resources. In low-resource settings, low vaccine pricing is essential for strategies of combined vaccination and screening to be cost-effective.

Cost-effectiveness of colorectal cancer screening in the average risk population.;Leshno M1, Halpern Z, Arber N.;Health Care Manag Sci. 2003 Aug.6(3):165-74.;Abstract Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer death in North America and in Israel. Risk of CRC increases exponentially with age starting at the age of 50 years. Therefore, people older than 50 years are being considered as an average risk population for CRC. The objective of this study was to obtain an improved assessment of the cost-effectiveness analysis of screening for CRC in the average risk population by using a more accurate technique, namely the Partially Observed Markov Decision Process (POMDP). We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis within the specific probability rates and costs in Israel. This study revealed that it is highly cost-effective to screen average-risk asymptomatic individuals.;Algorithms,Colonoscopy/economics,Colonoscopy/methods,Colorectal Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Colorectal Neoplasms/economics,Colorectal Neoplasms/epidemiology,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Humans,Israel/epidemiology,Life Expectancy,Markov Chains,Mass Screening/economics*,Occult Blood,Risk Factors;12943152;

Cost-Effectiveness of Different Cervical Screening Strategies in Islamic Republic of Iran: A Middle-Income Country with a Low Incidence Rate of Cervical Cancer.;Nahvijou A1, Daroudi R2, Tahmasebi M1, Amouzegar Hashemi F1, Rezaei Hemami M3, Akbari Sari A2, Barati Marenani A4, Zendehdel K5.;PLoS One. 2016 Jun 8.11(6):e0156705. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0156705. eCollection 2016.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: Invasive cervical cancer (ICC) is the fourth most common cancer among women worldwide. Cervical screening programs have reduced the incidence and mortality rates of ICC. We studied the cost-effectiveness of different cervical screening strategies in the Islamic Republic of Iran, a Muslim country with a low incidence rate of ICC. METHODS: We constructed an 11-state Markov model, in which the parameters included regression and progression probabilities, test characteristics, costs, and utilities. these were extracted from primary data and the literature. Our strategies included Pap smear screening and human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing plus Pap smear triaging with different starting ages and screening intervals. Model outcomes included lifetime costs, life years gained, quality-adjusted life years (QALY), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). One-way sensitivity analysis was performed to examine the stability of the results. RESULTS: We found that the prevented mortalities for the 11 strategies compared with no screening varied from 26% to 64%. The most cost-effective strategy was HPV screening, starting at age 35 years and repeated every 10 years. The ICER of this strategy was $8,875 per QALY compared with no screening. We found that screening at 5-year intervals was also cost-effective based on GDP per capita in Iran. CONCLUSION: We recommend organized cervical screening with HPV DNA testing for women in Iran, beginning at age 35 and repeated every 10 or 5 years. The results of this study could be generalized to other countries with low incidence rates of cervical cancer.;Adult,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Costs and Cost Analysis,Female,Humans,Incidence,Iran/epidemiology,Mass Screening/economics*,Middle Aged,Models, Economic*,Papanicolaou Test/economics*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms*/diagnosis,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms*/economics,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms*/mortality;27276093;
Cost-effectiveness of digital mammography screening before the age of 50 in The Netherlands.;Sankatsing VD1, Heijnsdijk EA1, van Luijt PA1, van Ravesteyn NT1, Fracheboud J1, de Koning HJ1.;Int J Cancer. 2015 Oct 15.137(8):1990-9. doi: 10.1002/ijc.29572. Epub 2015 May 8.;Abstract In the Netherlands, routine mammography screening starts at age 50. This starting age may have to be reconsidered because of the increasing breast cancer incidence among women aged 40 to 49 and the recent implementation of digital mammography. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of digital mammography screening that starts between age 40 and 49, using a microsimulation model. Women were screened before age 50, in addition to the current programme (biennial 50-74). Screening strategies varied in starting age (between 40 and 50) and frequency (annual or biennial). The numbers of breast cancers diagnosed, life-years gained (LYG) and breast cancer deaths averted were predicted and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated to compare screening scenarios. Biennial screening from age 50 to 74 (current strategy) was estimated to gain 157 life years per 1,000 women with lifelong follow-up, compared to a situation without screening, and cost ¢??3,376/LYG (3.5% discounted). Additional screening increased the number of LYG, compared to no screening, ranging from 168 to 242. The costs to generate one additional LYG (i.e., ICER), comparing a screening strategy to the less intensive alternative, were estimated at ¢??5,329 (biennial 48-74 vs. current strategy), ¢??7,628 (biennial 45-74 vs. biennial 48-74), ¢??10,826 (biennial 40-74 vs. biennial 45-74) and ¢??18,759 (annual 40-49¢??+¢??biennial 50-74 vs. biennial 40-74). Other strategies (49¢??+¢??biennial 50-74 and annual 45-49¢??+¢??biennial 50-74) resulted in less favourable ICERs. These findings show that extending the Dutch screening programme by screening between age 40 and 49 is cost-effective, particularly for biennial strategies.;Adult,Aged,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Computer Simulation,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Early Detection of Cancer/economics,Early Detection of Cancer/methods*,Female,Humans,Mammography/economics*,Mammography/methods,Mass Screening,Middle Aged,Netherlands;25895135;
Cost-effectiveness of early detection of breast cancer in Catalonia (Spain).;Carles M1, Vilaprinyo E, Cots F, Gregori A, Pla R, Romƒön R, Sala M, Maciƒÿ F, Castells X, Rue M.;BMC Cancer. 2011 May 23.11:192. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-11-192.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Breast cancer (BC) causes more deaths than any other cancer among women in Catalonia. Early detection has contributed to the observed decline in BC mortality. However, there is debate on the optimal screening strategy. We performed an economic evaluation of 20 screening strategies taking into account the cost over time of screening and subsequent medical costs, including diagnostic confirmation, initial treatment, follow-up and advanced care. METHODS: We used a probabilistic model to estimate the effect and costs over time of each scenario. The effect was measured as years of life (YL), quality-adjusted life years (QALY), and lives extended (LE). Costs of screening and treatment were obtained from the Early Detection Program and hospital databases of the IMAS-Hospital del Mar in Barcelona. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was used to compare the relative costs and outcomes of different scenarios. RESULTS: Strategies that start at ages 40 or 45 and end at 69 predominate when the effect is measured as YL or QALYs. Biennial strategies 50-69, 45-69 or annual 45-69, 40-69 and 40-74 were selected as cost-effective for both effect measures (YL or QALYs). The ICER increases considerably when moving from biennial to annual scenarios. Moving from no screening to biennial 50-69 years represented an ICER of 4,469¢?? per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: A reduced number of screening strategies have been selected for consideration by researchers, decision makers and policy planners. Mathematical models are useful to assess the impact and costs of BC screening in a specific geographical area.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/economics*,Breast Neoplasms/mortality,Breast Neoplasms/therapy,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Early Detection of Cancer/economics*,Female,Humans,Life Expectancy,Mammography,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,Spain;21605383;

Cost-effectiveness of HPV-based cervical cancer screening in the public health system in Nicaragua.;;BMJ Open. 2017 Jun 15.7(6):e015048. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2016-015048.;Abstract OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing (versus Papanicolaou (Pap)-based screening) for cervical cancer screening in Nicaragua. DESIGN: A previously developed Monte Carlo simulation model of the natural history of HPV infection and cervical cancer was calibrated to epidemiological data from Nicaragua. Cost data inputs were derived using a micro-costing approach in Carazo, Chontales and Chinandega departments. test performance data were from a demonstration project in Masaya department. SETTING: Nicaragua's public health sector facilities. PARTICIPANTS: Women aged 30-59 years. INTERVENTIONS: Screening strategies included (1) Pap testing every 3 years, with referral to colposcopy for women with an atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance or worse result ('Pap'). (2) HPV testing every 5 years, with referral to cryotherapy for HPV-positive eligible women (HPV cryotherapy or 'HPV-Cryo'). (3) HPV testing every 5 years, with referral to triage with visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) for HPV-positive women ('HPV-VIA'). and (4) HPV testing every 5 years, with referral to Pap testing for HPV-positive women ('HPV-Pap'). OUTCOME MEASURES: Reduction in lifetime risk of cancer and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER. 2015 US$ per year of life saved (YLS)). RESULTS: HPV-based screening strategies were more effective than Pap testing. HPV-Cryo was the least costly and most effective strategy, reducing lifetime cancer risk by 29.5% and outperforming HPV-VIA, HPV-Pap and Pap only, which reduced cancer risk by 19.4%, 12.2% and 10.8%, respectively. With an ICER of US$320/YLS, HPV-Cryo every 5 years would be very cost-effective using a threshold based on Nicaragua's per capita gross domestic product of US$2090. Findings were robust across sensitivity analyses on test performance, coverage, compliance and cost parameters. CONCLUSIONS: HPV testing is very cost-effective compared with Pap testing in Nicaragua, due to higher test sensitivity and the relatively lower number of visits required. Increasing compliance with recommended follow-up will further improve the health benefits and value for public health dollars. ¯õ?

Cost-effectiveness of increasing cervical cancer screening coverage in the Middle East: An example from Lebanon.;Sharma M1, Seoud M2, Kim JJ3.;Vaccine. 2017 Jan 23.35(4):564-569. doi: 10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.12.015. Epub 2016 Dec 22.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Most cervical cancer (CC) cases in Lebanon are detected at later stages and associated with high mortality. There is no national organized CC screening program so screening is opportunistic and limited to women who can pay out-of-pocket. Therefore, a small percentage of women receive repeated screenings while most are under-or never screened. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of increasing screening coverage and extending intervals. METHODS: We used an individual-based Monte Carlo model simulating HPV and CC natural history and screening. We calibrated the model to epidemiological data from Lebanon, including CC incidence and HPV type distribution. We evaluated cytology and HPV DNA screening for women aged 25-65years, varying coverage from 20 to 70% and frequency from 1 to 5years. RESULTS: At 20% coverage, annual cytologic screening reduced lifetime CC risk by 14% and had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of I$80,670/year of life saved (YLS), far exceeding Lebanon's gross domestic product (GDP) per capita (I$17,460), a commonly cited cost-effectiveness threshold. By comparison, increasing cytologic screening coverage to 50% and extending screening intervals to 3 and 5years provided greater CC reduction (26.1% and 21.4, respectively) at lower costs compared to 20% coverage with annual screening. Screening every 5years with HPV DNA testing at 50% coverage provided greater CC reductions than cytology at the same frequency (23.4%) and was cost-effective assuming a cost of I$18 per HPV test administered (I$12,210/YLS). HPV DNA testing every 4years at 50% coverage was also cost-effective at the same cost per test (I$16,340). Increasing coverage of annual cytology was not found to be cost-effective. CONCLUSION: Current practice of repeated cytology in a small percentage of women is inefficient. Increasing coverage to 50% with extended screening intervals provides greater health benefits at a reasonable cost and can more equitably distribute health gains. Novel HPV DNA strategies offer greater CC reductions and may be more cost-effective than cytology. Copyright ¯õ? 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Cost-effectiveness of multiple screening modalities on breast cancer in Chinese women from Shanghai].;;Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi. 2017 Dec 10.38(12):1665-1671. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0254-6450.2017.12.017.;Abstract Objective: To determine the most cost-effective modality for breast cancer screening in women living in Shanghai. Methods: A Markov model for breast cancer was redeveloped based on true effect which was derived from a project for detection of women at high risk of breast cancer and an organized breast cancer screening program conducted simultaneously in Minhang district, Shanghai, during 2008 to 2012. Parameters of the model were derived from literatures. General principles related to cost-effectiveness analysis were used to compare the costs and effects of 12 different screening modalities in a simulated cohort involving 100 000 women aged 45 years. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was used to determine the most cost-effective modality. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate how these factors affected the estimated cost-effectiveness. Results: The modality of biennial CBE followed by ultrasonic and mammography among those with positive CBE was observed as the most cost-effective one. The costs appeared as 182 526 Yuan RMB per life year gained and 144 386 Yuan RMB per quality adjusted life-year (QALY) saved, which were within the threshold of 2-3 times of local per capita Gross Domestic Product. Results from sensitivity analysis showed that, due to higher incidence rate of breast cancer in Shanghai, the cost per QALY would be 64 836 Yuan RMB lower in Shanghai than the average level in China. Conclusion: Our research findings showed that the biennial CBE program followed by ultrasonic and mammography for those with positive CBE results might serve as the optimal breast cancer screening modality for Chinese women living in Shanghai, and thus be widely promoted in this population elsewhere.;Asian Continental Ancestry Group/statistics & numerical data*,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/economics,Breast Neoplasms/ethnology,Breast Neoplasms/prevention & control,China,Cost-Benefit Analysis*,Early Detection of Cancer/economics*,Female,Humans,Mammography/economics*,Markov Chains,Mass Screening/economics*,Mass Screening/methods,Models, Theoretical,Quality-Adjusted Life Years;29294584;

Cost-effectiveness of screening for colorectal cancer in France using a guaiac test versus an immunochemical test.;Lejeune C1, Dancourt V, Arveux P, Bonithon-Kopp C, Faivre J.;Int J Technol Assess Health Care. 2010 Jan.26(1):40-7. doi: 10.1017/S026646230999078X.;Abstract OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare the cost and the effectiveness of two biennial fecal occult blood screening tests for colorectal cancer: a guaiac nonrehydrated test (G-FOBT) and an immunochemical test (I-FOBT) with the absence of screening. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to compare these strategies in a general population of subjects aged 50 to 74 over a 20-year period. RESULTS: Compared with the absence of screening, G-FOBT and I-FOBT were associated with a decrease in colorectal cancer mortality of 17.4 percent and 25.2 percent, respectively. With regard to cost-effectiveness, expressed as cost per life-year gained, I-FOBT was the most effective and most costly alternative. Compared with no screening, G-FOBT and I-FOBT presented similar discounted incremental cost-effectiveness ratios: 2,739 euros and 2,819 euros respectively per life-year gained. When compared with G-FOBT, I-FOBT presented an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 2,988 euros per life-year gained. Sensitivity analyses showed the strong influence of the I-FOBT lead time, of the participation rate to screening for I-FOBT, and of the purchase price of the I-FOBT on the discounted incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the absence of screening and with G-FOBT, the biennial two-stool immunochemical test can be considered a promising method for mass screening for colorectal cancer.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Aged,Colorectal Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Colorectal Neoplasms/economics*,Cost-Benefit Analysis,France,Guaiac,Humans,Immunologic Tests,Indicators and Reagents,Markov Chains,Mass Screening/economics*,Mass Screening/methods,Middle Aged,Occult Blood,Sensitivity and Specificity,Indicators and Reagents,Guaiac;20059779;
Cost-effectiveness of screening for colorectal cancer in the general population.;;JAMA. 2000 Oct 18.284(15):1954-61.;Abstract CONTEXT: A recent expert panel recommended that persons at average risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) begin screening for CRC at age 50 years using 1 of several strategies. However, many aspects of different CRC screening strategies remain uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To assess the consequences, costs, and cost-effectiveness of CRC screening in average-risk individuals. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis from a societal perspective using a Markov model. SUBJECTS: Hypothetical subjects representative of the 50-year-old US population at average risk for CRC. SETTING: Simulated clinical practice in the United States. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Discounted lifetime costs, life expectancy, and incremental cost-effectiveness (CE) ratio, compared used 22 different CRC screening strategies, including those recommended by the expert panel. RESULTS: In 1 base-case analysis, compliance was assumed to be 60% with the initial screen and 80% with follow-up or surveillance colonoscopy. The most effective strategy for white men was annual rehydrated fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) plus sigmoidoscopy (followed by colonoscopy if either a low- or high-risk polyp was found) every 5 years from age 50 to 85 years, which resulted in a 60% reduction in cancer incidence and an 80% reduction in CRC mortality compared with no screening, and an incremental CE ratio of $92,900 per year of life gained compared with annual unrehydrated FOBT plus sigmoidoscopy every 5 years. In a base-case analysis in which compliance with screening and follow-up is assumed to be 100%, screening more often than every 10 years was prohibitively expensive. annual rehydrated FOBT plus sigmoidoscopy every 5 years had an incremental CE ratio of $489,900 per life-year gained compared with the same strategy every 10 years. Other strategies recommended by the expert panel were either less effective or cost more per year of life gained than the alternatives. Colonoscopy every 10 years was less effective than the combination of annual FOBT plus sigmoidoscopy every 5 years. However, a single colonoscopy at age 55 years achieves nearly half of the reduction in CRC mortality obtainable with colonoscopy every 10 years. Because of increased life expectancy among white women and increased cancer mortality among blacks, CRC screening was even more cost-effective in these groups than in white men. CONCLUSIONS: Screening for CRC, even in the setting of imperfect compliance, significantly reduces CRC mortality at costs comparable to other cancer screening procedures. However, compliance rates significantly affect the incremental CE ratios. In this model of CRC, 60% compliance with an every 5-year schedule of screening was roughly equivalent to 100% compliance with an every 10-year schedule. Mathematical modeling used to inform clinical guidelines needs to take into account expected compliance rates.

Cost-effectiveness of screening the average-risk population for colorectal cancer.;;Gastrointest Endosc Clin N Am. 2002 Jan.12(1):93-109.;Abstract This article reviews several of the recent models addressing the cost-effectiveness of colorectal cancer screening in the average-risk individual (Table 1). How can clinicians and policy makers use this information for decision making regarding colorectal cancer screening? The cost-effectiveness ratios reported by themselves do not identify cost-effective practices. They must be placed in a decision context that is expressed in one of two forms. In the first form, an explicit threshold or maximum amount that a policy maker is willing to spend is stated (e.g., $40,000 per LY gained, as has been quoted as an acceptable amount for a prevention program). In the second form of decision context, a list of medical practices and their associated cost-effectiveness ratios, also known as a league table (Table 2) is used as a basis for comparison with the practice under evaluation (e.g., colorectal cancer screening). The practice with the lowest cost-effectiveness ratio is the most cost-effective practice on the list. Practices with lower cost-effectiveness ratios are considered cost-effective compared with those with higher ratios. Table 2 lists incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for common medical practices. The models discussed in this article suggested that colorectal cancer screening using annual FOBT, flexible sigmoidoscopy at 3 or 5 years, the combination of FOBT and flexible sigmoidoscopy, barium enema, colonoscopy, and even virtual colonoscopy had incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranging from $6300 to $92,900 per LY saved with most of the cost-effectiveness ratio ranging from $10,000 to $40,000 per LY saved. These ratios are similar to the cost of another widely accepted practice, breast cancer screening with annual mammography in women age 50 and older ($22,000 per LY gained). Colorectal cancer screening with any of the modalities discussed is considered less cost-effective than screening for hemochromatosis, which has an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $3665 per LY saved. Based on these ratios, however, screening for colorectal cancer is considered cost-effective compared with cervical cancer screening in women age 20 and older with pap smear every 3 years, which has an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $250,000 per LY gained. The clinician can use these incremental cost-effectiveness ratios to evaluate the risks and benefits of alternative practices for the individual, and the policy maker with a limited health care budget can use these ratios to set priorities for funding based on the costs and the expected gains in life expectancy for colorectal cancer screening and for alternative health care programs.;Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.,Colonoscopy/economics*,Colorectal Neoplasms/economics*,Colorectal Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Humans,Life Expectancy,Mass Screening/economics*,Models, Economic,Sigmoidoscopy/economics,United States,Value of Life,1 K24 CA83885-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;11916165;
Cost-effectiveness of the conventional papanicolaou test with a new adjunct to cytological screening for squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix and its precursors.;Taylor LA1, Sorensen SV, Ray NF, Halpern MT, Harper DM.;Arch Fam Med. 2000 Aug.9(8):713-21.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: To estimate costs and outcomes of conventional annual Papanicolaou (Pap) test screening compared with biennial Pap test plus speculoscopy (PPS) screening for cervical neoplasms. DESIGN: A Markov model compared cost-effectiveness and outcomes of annual Pap tests with biennial PPS. The model includes direct costs of screening, diagnostic testing, and treatment for squamous intraepitheial lesions and invasive cancers. indirect costs (eg, lost productivity because of cervical cancer). and newer management practices, including human papillomavirus DNA testing. PATIENTS: Women aged 18 to 64 years. INTERVENTION: Screening for cervical neoplasms with either annual Pap smear test or biennial PPS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Marginal cost per life-year gained. RESULTS: The probability of women having squamous intraepithelial lesions, cervical cancer, or death from cervical cancer was lower among women undergoing PPS biennially. A total of 12 additional days of life per woman was gained with biennial PPS during the 47-year model period. Total average cumulative direct medical costs per patient were $1419 for biennial PPS compared with $1489 for annual Pap tests. Total costs, including direct medical costs and indirect costs, were $2185 for PPS compared with $3179 for Pap tests alone. Increased savings and patient outcomes were observed in high-risk populations. CONCLUSION: Our simulations indicate that biennial screening with PPS is expected to provide cost savings for women older than 18 years compared with annual Pap test screening, especially for those in high-risk populations.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/economics*,Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/prevention & control*,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Female,Humans,Markov Chains,Mass Screening/economics*,Mass Screening/methods*,Middle Aged,Papanicolaou Test*,Risk,Time Factors,United States,Uterine Cervical Dysplasia/diagnosis*,Uterine Cervical Dysplasia/economics*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/economics*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Vaginal Smears/economics*;10927709;

Costs and cost-effectiveness of full implementation of a biennial faecal occult blood test screening program for bowel cancer in Australia.;;Med J Aust. 2011 Feb 21.194(4):180-5.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: To examine the costs and cost-effectiveness of full implementation of biennial bowel cancer screening for Australian residents aged 50-74 years. DESIGN AND SETTING: Identification of existing economic models from 1993 to 2010 through searches of PubMed and economic analysis databases, and by seeking expert advice. and additional modelling to determine the costs and cost-effectiveness of full implementation of biennial faecal occult blood test screening for the five million adults in Australia aged 50-74 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Estimated number of deaths from bowel cancer prevented, costs, and cost-effectiveness (cost per life-year gained [LYG]) of biennial bowel cancer screening. RESULTS: We identified six relevant economic analyses, all of which found colorectal cancer (CRC) screening to be very cost-effective, with costs per LYG under $55,000 per year in 2010 Australian dollars. Based on our additional modelling, we conservatively estimate that full implementation of biennial screening for people aged 50-74 years would have gross costs of $150 million, reduce CRC mortality by 15%-25%, prevent 300-500 deaths from bowel cancer, and save 3600-6000 life-years annually, for an undiscounted cost per LYG of $25,000-$41,667, compared with no screening, and not taking cost savings as a result of treatment into consideration. The additional expenditure required, after accounting for reductions in CRC incidence, savings in CRC treatment costs, and existing ad-hoc colonoscopy use, is likely to be less than $50 million annually. CONCLUSIONS: Full implementation of biennial faecal occult blood test screening in Australia can reduce bowel cancer mortality, and is an efficient use of health resources that would require modest additional government investment.;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Aged,Australia/epidemiology,Colonic Neoplasms/diagnosis,Colonic Neoplasms/economics,Colonic Neoplasms/mortality,Colonic Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Costs and Cost Analysis/economics,Costs and Cost Analysis/statistics & numerical data,Female,Humans,Male,Mass Screening/economics*,Middle Aged,Models, Economic,Occult Blood*,K05 CA129166/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,K05 CA129166-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;21401458;

Costs, effects and cost-effectiveness of breast cancer control in Ghana.;Zelle SG1, Nyarko KM, Bosu WK, Aikins M, Niƒ?ns LM, Lauer JA, Sepulveda CR, Hontelez JA, Baltussen R.;Trop Med Int Health. 2012 Aug.17(8):1031-43. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-3156.2012.03021.x. Epub 2012 Jul 19.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: Breast cancer control in Ghana is characterised by low awareness, late-stage treatment and poor survival. In settings with severely constrained health resources, there is a need to spend money wisely. To achieve this and to guide policy makers in their selection of interventions, this study systematically compares costs and effects of breast cancer control interventions in Ghana. METHODS: We used a mathematical model to estimate costs and health effects of breast cancer interventions in Ghana from the healthcare perspective. Analyses were based on the WHO-CHOICE method, with health effects expressed in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), costs in 2009 US dollars (US$) and cost-effectiveness ratios (CERs) in US$ per DALY averted. Analyses were based on local demographic, epidemiological and economic data, to the extent these data were available. RESULTS: Biennial screening by clinical breast examination (CBE) of women aged 40-69 years, in combination with treatment of all stages, seems the most cost-effective intervention (costing $1299 per DALY averted). The intervention is also economically attractive according to international standards on cost-effectiveness. Mass media awareness raising (MAR) is the second best option (costing $1364 per DALY averted). Mammography screening of women of aged 40-69 years (costing $12,908 per DALY averted) cannot be considered cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: Both CBE screening and MAR seem economically attractive interventions. Given the uncertainty about the effectiveness of these interventions, only their phased introduction, carefully monitored and evaluated, is warranted. Moreover, their implementation is only meaningful if the capacity of basic cancer diagnostic, referral and treatment and possibly palliative services is simultaneously improved. ‚? 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Aged,Awareness*,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/economics*,Breast Neoplasms/therapy,Costs and Cost Analysis,Early Detection of Cancer/economics*,Female,Ghana/epidemiology,Health Education/methods,Humans,Mammography/economics,Mass Media,Middle Aged,Models, Economic,Neoplasm Staging,Palliative Care/economics,Socioeconomic Factors;22809238;

Determinants of cancer screening frequency: the example of screening for cervical cancer.;;J Am Board Fam Pract. 1998 Mar-Apr.11(2):87-95.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Cancer screening frequency should be based on the rate of progression of the disease and the sensitivity of the screening test. A common misconception is that a person's risk of getting the disease determines how often they should be screened. METHODS: We describe algebraically the theoretical interaction of disease progression rate and screening test sensitivity determining the portion of invasive cancers prevented by screening. After discussing the assumptions and limitations of the model, we apply this model to the example of screening for cervical cancer. Actual data from large screening programs assembled by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) are used to test the assumptions of the model. RESULTS: A simple formula can express the relation between disease progression rate, sensitivity of the screening test, screening frequency, and screening error. Disease prevalence does not figure in this equation. The IARC data suggest that, at least for cervical cancer, as screening frequency increases, incremental sensitivity of the test decreases or remaining undetected cases progress more rapidly so that anticipated benefits from more frequent screening are not realized. CONCLUSIONS: Rate of disease progression and sensitivity of the screening test are the proper determinants of cancer screening frequency. Because these factors can vary depending on screening frequency, however, the optimal screening interval for a particular cancer must be determined by clinical trials.;Data Interpretation, Statistical,Disease Progression,Female,Humans,Mass Screening/methods,Mass Screening/statistics & numerical data*,Models, Statistical*,Sensitivity and Specificity,Time Factors,United States,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Vaginal Smears;9542700;

Do women >or=50 years of age need as much screening as women <50 years after they have had negative screening results?;Armaroli P1, Gallo F, Bellomi A, Ciatto S, Consonni D, Davi D, Giorgi-Rossi P, Iossa A, Mancini E, Naldoni C, Polla E, Ronco G, Serafini M, Vergini V, Zanier L, Zappa M, Segnan N.;Br J Cancer. 2008 Jul 22.99(2):239-44. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6604455. Epub 2008 Jul 1.;Abstract To assess the adequacy of a routine screening to identify cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 or worse (CIN2+) in women over 50 years of age, a retrospective cohort was set in six Italian organised population-based screening programmes. In all, 287 330 women (1 714 550 person-years of observation, 1110 cases) screened at age 25-64, with at least two cytological screening tests, the first negative, were followed from their first negative smear until a biopsy proven CIN2+ lesion or their last negative smear. For women aged 25-49 and 50-64 years, crude and age-standardised detection rate (DR), cumulative risk (CR), adjusted hazard risk for number of previous negative screens, probability of false-positive CIN2+ after two or more smear tests were calculated. Detection rate is significantly lower over 50 years of age. Multivariable analysis shows a significant protective effect from four screening episodes (DR=0.70, 95% CI: 0.51-0.97). the effect of age >or=50 is 0.29 (95% CI: 0.24-0.35). The CR of CIN2+ is at least eightfold higher in women <50 (CR=2.06, 95% CI: 1.88-2.23) after one previous negative test than in women >or=50 years with four screens (CR=0.23, 95% CI: 0.00-0.46). Over 50 years of age, after four tests at least three false-positive cases are diagnosed for every true positive.

Economic analysis of outreach assessment clinics in breast screening programmes.;;Int J Health Plann Manage. 1999 Jan-Mar.14(1):57-67.;Abstract A model is developed for the economic evaluation of outreach assessment clinics following screening and used to identify the cost-minimizing strategy for assessing women from three island communities in the Scottish Breast Screening Programme (SBSP). There are four options of interest depending on: whether the women are assessed on the mainland or at outreach assessment clinics. and whether all women have two view screening rather than only those being screened for the first time. The benefits of outreach assessment are assumed to be solely in terms of convenience to women and reductions in the time and travel costs of women recalled for assessment. The costs are modelled in order to compare outreach and no outreach options. The results show that for the numbers of women currently screened outreach assessment is the cost-minimizing strategy. The model provides useful guidance with respect to screening policy and is readily applied to the case of outreach assessment in mainland communities outwith major population centres and to breast and other screening programmes in other countries.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/prevention & control,Community Health Services/economics*,Community Health Services/organization & administration,Community-Institutional Relations,Data Collection,Female,Health Care Costs/statistics & numerical data,Health Services Research,Humans,Mammography/economics*,Mammography/utilization,Mass Screening/economics*,Models, Economic,Scotland;10351680;
Economic decision analysis model of screening for lung cancer;Marshall D., Simpson K.N., Earle C.C., Chu C.-W.;2001,European Journal of Cancer;The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential clinical and economic implications of an annual lung cancer screening programme based on helical computed tomography (CT). A decision analysis model was created using combined data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) registry public-use database and published results from the Early Lung Cancer Action Project (ELCAP). We found that under optimal conditions in a high risk cohort of patients between 60 and 74 years of age, annual lung cancer screening over a period of 5 years appears to be cost effective at approximately $19 000 per life year saved. A sensitivity analysis of the model to account for a 1-year decrease in survival benefit and changes in assumptions for incidence rate and costs generated cost effectiveness estimates ranging from approximately $10 800 to $62 000 per life year saved. Based on the assumptions embedded in this model, annual screening of high risk elderly patients for lung cancer may be cost effective under optimal conditions, but longer term data are needed to confirm if this will be borne out in practice. ? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Economic evaluation of the breast cancer screening programme in the Basque Country: retrospective cost-effectiveness and budget impact analysis.;Arrospide A1,2,3, Rue M4,5, van Ravesteyn NT6, Comas M4,7, Soto-Gordoa M8, Sarriugarte G9, Mar J8,10,4,11.;BMC Cancer. 2016 Jun 1.16:344. doi: 10.1186/s12885-016-2386-y.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Breast cancer screening in the Basque Country has shown 20 % reduction of the number of BC deaths and an acceptable overdiagnosis level (4 % of screen detected BC). The aim of this study was to evaluate the breast cancer early detection programme in the Basque Country in terms of retrospective cost-effectiveness and budget impact from 1996 to 2011. METHODS: A discrete event simulation model was built to reproduce the natural history of breast cancer (BC). We estimated for lifetime follow-up the total cost of BC (screening, diagnosis and treatment), as well as quality-adjusted life years (QALY), for women invited to participate in the evaluated programme during the 15-year period in the actual screening scenario and in a hypothetical unscreened scenario. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated with the use of aggregated costs. Besides, annual costs were considered for budget impact analysis. Both population level and single-cohort analysis were performed. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was applied to assess the impact of parameters uncertainty. RESULTS: The actual screening programme involved a cost of 1,127 million euros and provided 6.7 million QALYs over the lifetime of the target population, resulting in a gain of 8,666 QALYs for an additional cost of 36.4 million euros, compared with the unscreened scenario. Thus, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 4,214¢??/QALY. All the model runs in the probabilistic sensitivity analysis resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio lower than 10,000¢??/QALY. The screening programme involved an increase of the annual budget of the Basque Health Service by 5.2 million euros from year 2000 onwards. CONCLUSIONS: The BC screening programme in the Basque Country proved to be cost-effective during the evaluated period and determined an affordable budget impact. These results confirm the epidemiological benefits related to the centralised screening system and support the continuation of the programme.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Cost-Benefit Analysis/methods*,Early Detection of Cancer/economics*,Female,Humans,Mass Screening/economics*,Mass Screening/methods,Middle Aged,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,Retrospective Studies,Spain;27251556;

Effect of Cervical Cancer Screening Programs on Preterm Birth: A Decision and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis.;;Obstet Gynecol. 2017 Dec.130(6):1207-1217. doi: 10.1097/AOG.0000000000002366.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of age at initiation and interval of cervical cancer screening in women of reproductive age on the risk of future preterm birth and subsequent adverse neonatal outcome relative to maternal life-years gained and cost of both screening and preterm birth. METHODS: In this decision and cost-effectiveness analysis, we compared eight cytology-based screening programs varying in age of onset (21, 24, 25, 27, or 30 years) and screening interval (3 or 5 years) in a fictive cohort of 100,000 women. We used the microsimulation screening analysis model to estimate number of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia diagnoses, large loop excisions of the transformation zone (LLETZs), life-years gained, cervical cancer cases, deaths, and costs of screening and treatment. We used the number of LLETZs to calculate additional preterm births, subsequent neonatal morbidity, mortality, and associated costs. RESULTS: The number of LLETZs per 100,000 women varied from 9,612 for the most intensive screening (every 3 years from age 21 years) to 4,646 for the least intensive screening (every 5 years from age 30 years). Compared with the least intensive program, the most intensive program increased maternal life-years gained by 9% (10,728 compared with 9,839), decreased cervical cancer cases by 67% (52 compared with 158), and cervical cancer deaths by 75% (four compared with 16) at the expense of 250% (158 compared with 45) more preterm births and 320% (four compared with one) more neonatal deaths while increasing total costs by $55 million ($77 compared with $23 million). The number of maternal life-years gained per additional preterm birth varied from 68 to 258 with subsequent total costs per maternal life-years gained of $7,212 and $2,329. CONCLUSION: Cervical cancer screening every 3 years and subsequent treatment in women aged younger than 30 years yield limited life-years but may have substantial perinatal adverse effects. Consequently, women who plan to have children may benefit from a more cautious screening approach, taking into account their risk for both cancer and preterm birth.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Age Factors,Australia,Cervix Uteri/pathology,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Cytodiagnosis/methods,Cytodiagnosis/statistics & numerical data,Early Detection of Cancer*/adverse effects,Early Detection of Cancer*/economics,Early Detection of Cancer*/methods,Efficiency, Organizational,Female,Humans,Infant,Infant Mortality,Life Tables,Netherlands,Pregnancy,Premature Birth*/economics,Premature Birth*/prevention & control,Risk Assessment,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms*/diagnosis,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms*/prevention & control;29112652;

Effect of type-specific human papillomavirus incidence on screening performance and cost.;;Int J Gynecol Cancer. 2010 Feb.20(2):276-82. doi: 10.1111/IGC.0b013e3181ca5df3.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Implementation of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination is expected to change the epidemiology of HPV infection. METHODS: Using age-dependent (inhomogeneous) Markov chains, we tested the effect of type-specific (ie, HPV-16/HPV-18 and other high-risk HPV types) HPV incidence on 3 screening strategies in a cohort of 100,000 women, starting screening at the age of 25 years and continuing until the age of 34 years. All the strategies started with an HPV test. if the result was positive, the next step was triage with cytology (strategy 1), cytology and colposcopy together (strategy 2), or colposcopy only (strategy 3). Published background data were used for the models. RESULTS: Strategy 2 had the highest sensitivity. the absolute number of missed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)3+ cases was associated with HPV incidence in all the strategies, but their relative sensitivity remained unaffected. Strategy 2 was cheaper per diagnosed CIN3+ for very low HPV incidence rates, but this changed for higher incidence rates. For any given pair of HPV-16/HPV-18 and other high-risk-type incidence, the cost of the triage and the total cost of screening was highest in screening 2 and lowest in screening 1. For each screening strategy, the cost per diagnosed CIN3+ was mainly determined by the incidence of HPV-16/HPV-18, and the cost of the triage and the total screening cost by the incidence of other high-risk types. CONCLUSIONS: Type-specific HPV incidence affects the absolute number of missed CIN3+ cases and the cost of screening in a mathematically describable way and can be used for prediction of changes in these outcomes with changing HPV epidemiology.;Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/diagnosis,Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/virology,Female,Human papillomavirus 16*,Human papillomavirus 18*,Humans,Incidence,Markov Chains,Mass Screening/economics*,Models, Theoretical,Papillomavirus Infections/diagnosis*,Papillomavirus Infections/epidemiology*,Papillomavirus Infections/virology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/virology;20134270;
Effectiveness and health economic analysis of strategies on cervical cancer screening and early diagnosis and treatment].;Zhao FH1, Chen JF, Gao XH, Gao LM, Liu QG, Liu ZH, Xu H, Ma JF, Ma L, Xu XL, Hu SY, Ning Y, Shi JF, Qiao YL.;Zhonghua Zhong Liu Za Zhi. 2012 Aug.34(8):632-6. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-3766.2012.08.017.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: To explore the appropriate strategies which are suitable for the areas with diverse health and economic resource settings in China by estimating the life outcomes and cost-effectiveness of several cervical cancer screening strategies. METHODS: Markov model was used to calculate the long-term effectiveness, utility, benefit and cost among screened and unscreened cohorts in rural and urban areas, and then analyses of cost-effectiveness, cost-utility and cost-benefit were performed. The assessed screening strategies were acetic acid of visual inspection combined with Lugol's iodine staining (VIA/VILI), conventional Pap smear and simple HPV DNA testing (careHPV) in rural areas, and conventional Pap smear, simple HPV DNA testing (careHPV), HPV DNA testing (HC2) and liquid-based cytology (LBC) alone or combined with HPV DNA testing (LBC+HC2) in urban areas. We estimated the life outcomes and cost-effectiveness of the above screening strategies at one-year, 3-year and 5-year intervals. RESULTS: All of the screening strategies were effective to decrease cervical cancer mortality and to increase life years, with a trend of shorter screening interval having better effectiveness. However, no matter in urban or rural areas, compared with careHPV testing at 5-year interval, the costs of other screening strategies were 1.28 - 13.86 folds, 1.31 - 14.14 folds, and 1.27 - 12.80 folds higher to avoid one death, to save a year of life, and a QALY, and the benefit per cost of other screening strategies was 9.9%-90.2%. CONCLUSIONS: careHPV testing at 5-year interval has the best cost-effectiveness performance and the highest benefit-cost ratio with the moderate life outcomes. It is the optimal cervical cancer screening strategy to be generalized in our country. careHPV testing at 3 years interval can be considered in more developed areas to achieve better effectiveness.;English Abstract,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Acetic Acid,Adult,Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/diagnosis,Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/economics,Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/epidemiology,Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/virology,China/epidemiology,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Cytological Techniques,DNA, Viral/analysis,Early Detection of Cancer/economics,Early Detection of Cancer/methods*,Female,Human Papillomavirus DNA Tests,Humans,Iodides,Markov Chains,Mass Screening/economics,Mass Screening/methods*,Middle Aged,Models, Biological,Models, Statistical,Papanicolaou Test,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,Rural Population,Urban Population,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/economics*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/virology,Vaginal Smears,DNA, Viral,Iodides,Acetic Acid,Lugol's solution;23159002;
Effectiveness of early detection on breast cancer mortality reduction in Catalonia (Spain).;Rue M1, Vilaprinyo E, Lee S, Martinez-Alonso M, Carles MD, Marcos-Gragera R, Pla R, Espinas JA.;BMC Cancer. 2009 Sep 15.9:326. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-9-326.;Abstract BACKGROUND: At present, it is complicated to use screening trials to determine the optimal age intervals and periodicities of breast cancer early detection. Mathematical models are an alternative that has been widely used. The aim of this study was to estimate the effect of different breast cancer early detection strategies in Catalonia (Spain), in terms of breast cancer mortality reduction (MR) and years of life gained (YLG), using the stochastic models developed by Lee and Zelen (LZ). METHODS: We used the LZ model to estimate the cumulative probability of death for a cohort exposed to different screening strategies after T years of follow-up. We also obtained the cumulative probability of death for a cohort with no screening. These probabilities were used to estimate the possible breast cancer MR and YLG by age, period and cohort of birth. The inputs of the model were: incidence of, mortality from and survival after breast cancer, mortality from other causes, distribution of breast cancer stages at diagnosis and sensitivity of mammography. The outputs were relative breast cancer MR and YLG. RESULTS: Relative breast cancer MR varied from 20% for biennial exams in the 50 to 69 age interval to 30% for annual exams in the 40 to 74 age interval. When strategies differ in periodicity but not in the age interval of exams, biennial screening achieved almost 80% of the annual screening MR. In contrast to MR, the effect on YLG of extending screening from 69 to 74 years of age was smaller than the effect of extending the screening from 50 to 45 or 40 years. CONCLUSION: In this study we have obtained a measure of the effect of breast cancer screening in terms of mortality and years of life gained. The Lee and Zelen mathematical models have been very useful for assessing the impact of different modalities of early detection on MR and YLG in Catalonia (Spain).;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Aged,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/mortality*,Cohort Studies,Early Detection of Cancer*,Female,Humans,Mass Screening,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical,Spain;19754959;
Effects of mammography screening under different screening schedules: model estimates of potential benefits and harms.;Mandelblatt JS1, Cronin KA, Bailey S, Berry DA, de Koning HJ, Draisma G, Huang H, Lee SJ, Munsell M, Plevritis SK, Ravdin P, Schechter CB, Sigal B, Stoto MA, Stout NK, van Ravesteyn NT, Venier J, Zelen M, Feuer EJ.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate U.S. breast cancer screening strategies. DESIGN: 6 models using common data elements. DATA SOURCES: National data on age-specific incidence, competing mortality, mammography characteristics, and treatment effects. TARGET POPULATION: A contemporary population cohort. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTIONS: 20 screening strategies with varying initiation and cessation ages applied annually or biennially. OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of mammograms, reduction in deaths from breast cancer or life-years gained (vs. no screening), false-positive results, unnecessary biopsies, and overdiagnosis. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: The 6 models produced consistent rankings of screening strategies. Screening biennially maintained an average of 81% (range across strategies and models, 67% to 99%) of the benefit of annual screening with almost half the number of false-positive results. Screening biennially from ages 50 to 69 years achieved a median 16.5% (range, 15% to 23%) reduction in breast cancer deaths versus no screening. Initiating biennial screening at age 40 years (vs. 50 years) reduced mortality by an additional 3% (range, 1% to 6%), consumed more resources, and yielded more false-positive results. Biennial screening after age 69 years yielded some additional mortality reduction in all models, but overdiagnosis increased most substantially at older ages. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Varying test sensitivity or treatment patterns did not change conclusions. LIMITATION: Results do not include morbidity from false-positive results, patient knowledge of earlier diagnosis, or unnecessary treatment. CONCLUSION: Biennial screening achieves most of the benefit of annual screening with less harm. Decisions about the best strategy depend on program and individual objectives and the weight placed on benefits, harms, and resource considerations.

Efficacy and cost-effectiveness of nationwide cervical cancer screening in Taiwan.;;J Med Screen. 2006.13 Suppl 1:S44-7.;Abstract The annual cervical screening programme using the Papanicolaou (Pap) smear test was launched for women aged 30 years and over from 1995 in Taiwan. This study aimed to evaluate the Taiwanese cervical screening policy and to make recommendations based on the empirical findings from cervical screening data between 1995 and 1998. We used a stochastic process to model the natural history of precancerous lesions and cervical cancer. Based on the estimated results, Monte-Carlo computer simulation was used to evaluate the effectiveness in terms of the reduction in incidence of and mortality from cervical cancer for screening regimes with different screening intervals. Annual Pap smear screening with 100% compliance was estimated to lead to an approximate 80% reduction in deaths from cervical cancer. With 50% compliance, around a 40% reduction was expected. Triennial screening with high compliance was as effective as annual screening with low compliance, and more cost-effective. Based on the observed Taiwan Pap smear-screening programme between 1995 and 1998, with 44.5% women attending at least once, there was an estimated reduction of 16% in deaths from cervical carcinoma. The estimated effectiveness was greater when the period was extended to 2001, in which period 61% of women attended at least once. The screening programme by 2001 was estimated to reduce cervical cancer mortality by 50% (95% confidence interval: 29-65%). The incremental cost-effectiveness was estimated as 8174 dollars per additional life-year gained. In conclusion, triennial screening targeting women aged 30-69 is recommended, along with efforts to enhance the compliance rate.;Adult,Aged,Computer Simulation,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Female,Humans,Mass Screening/economics,Mass Screening/methods*,Mass Screening/statistics & numerical data,Middle Aged,Monte Carlo Method,Papanicolaou Test,Taiwan,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control,Vaginal Smears/methods,Vaginal Smears/statistics & numerical data;17227642;
Efficacy and cost-Effectiveness of screening colonoscopy according to the adenoma detection rate;Hassan C., Rex D.K., Zullo A., Kaminski M.F.;2015,United European Gastroenterology Journal;Background: The adenoma detection rate of the endoscopist has been related to the post-colonoscopy interval risk of colorectal cancer. Objective: The objective of this article is to estimate the impact of adenoma detection rate on the long-term colorectal cancer prevention rate. Methods: A Markov model was constructed to simulate the efficacy and cost of colonoscopy screening according to the adenoma detection rate of the endoscopist in 100,000 individuals. Post-colonoscopy interval colorectal cancer risk and the relative risk of interval cancer among endoscopists with different adenoma detection rates were extracted from the literature. A 1.5 relative risk was assumed between endoscopists with low and average adenoma detection rates, and a relative risk of 11 between those with average and high adenoma detection rates. Both efficacy and costs were projected over a steady-state American population. Results: Screening colonoscopy performed by endoscopists with low adenoma detection rates resulted in a 7% absolute reduction in the long-term colorectal cancer incidence prevention rate as compared to the same procedure performed by those with an average adenoma detection rate (70% vs. 77%). This difference increased to 21% when comparing endoscopists with an average with those with a high adenoma detection rate. When projected on the US population, this reduced efficacy resulted in an additional 1728 and 16,123 colorectal cancer cases and the loss of $117 million and $906 million per year in the two scenarios, respectively. These estimates were sensitive to the risk of post-colonoscopy interval colorectal cancer. Conclusions: A substantial reduction in long-term colorectal cancer prevention rate may be expected when screening colonoscopy is performed by endoscopists with a suboptimal adenoma detection rate. A substantial saving may be expected when implementing policies to improve endoscopist adenoma detection rate. ?

Efficacy of breast-cancer screening for female relatives of breast-cancer-index cases: Taiwan multicentre cancer screening (TAMCAS).;Lai MS1, Yen MF, Kuo HS, Koong SL, Chen TH, Duffy SW.;Int J Cancer. 1998 Sep 25.78(1):21-6.;Abstract Although the efficacy of mass screening for breast cancer has been established in Western countries, this strategy may be too costly for other countries with low incidence rates of breast cancer. We propose an alternative approach to screen female relatives of breast-cancer-index cases from hospitals, as part of the Taiwan multicentre cancer screening (TAMCAS) project. In order to assess the efficacy of this programme, and to estimate how often this high-risk group should be screened, we firstly elucidated the disease natural history from the pre-clinical screen-detectable phase (PCDP) by estimating the relevant parameters based on Markov chain models. We further predicted the proportion of interval cancers, advanced breast tumours and deaths from breast cancers by different screening frequencies. Results showed that the estimate of mean sojourn time (MST) for this high-risk group (1.9 years. 95% CI.1.18-4.86) is shorter than that for females from the general population. Analysis of a surrogate endpoint based on regional lymph-node spread and tumour size shows that annual screening for this high-risk group is likely to confer a significant 33% reduction in breast-cancer mortality compared with a non-significant 25 and 20% reduction for 2 yearly and 3-yearly screening regimes respectively. The above results suggest that a 1-year interval might be appropriate for this high-risk group. A simple cost-effectiveness analysis indicates a cost per year of life saved for mass screening ($72,480) 15 times that for the high-risk group ($4,851 ).;Multicenter Study,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Breast Neoplasms/mortality,Breast Neoplasms/pathology,Family Health*,Female,Humans,Incidence,Lymphatic Metastasis,Mass Screening/standards*,Program Evaluation,Taiwan/epidemiology;9724089;

Estimating key parameters in periodic breast cancer screening-application to the Canadian National Breast Screening Study data.;;Cancer Epidemiol. 2010 Aug.34(4):429-33. doi: 10.1016/j.canep.2010.04.001.;Abstract PROBLEM STATEMENT: Breast cancer screening in women of younger age has been controversial. The screening sensitivities, transition probabilities and sojourn time distributions are estimated for females aged 40-49 years and 50-59 years separately, using the Canadian National Breast Screening Study (CNBSS) data. The purpose is to estimate the lead time distribution and the probability of not detecting the cancer early. APPROACH: Within the 40-49-year-old and 50-59-year-old cohorts separately, the age-independent statistical model was applied. Bayesian estimators along with 95% highest probability density (HPD) credible intervals (CI) were calculated. Bayesian hypothesis testing was used to compare the parameter estimates of the two cohorts. The lead time density was also estimated for both the 40-49 and 50-59-year-old cohorts. RESULTS: The screening sensitivity, transition probability of the disease, and mean sojourn time were all found to increase with age. For the 40-49-year-old and 50-59-year-old cohorts, the posterior mean sensitivities were 0.70 (95% HPD-CI: 0.46, 0.93) and 0.77 (0.61, 0.93), respectively. The posterior mean transition probabilities were 0.0023 (0.0018, 0.0027) and 0.0031 (0.0024, 0.0038), while the posterior mean sojourn times were 2.55 (1.56, 4.26) years and 3.15 (2.12, 4.96) years. Bayes factors for the ratio of posterior probabilities that the respective parameter was larger vs. smaller in the 50-59-year-old cohort were estimated to be 2.09, 40.8 and 3.0 for the sensitivity, transition probability, and mean sojourn time, respectively. All three Bayes factors were larger than two, indicating greater than 2:1 odds in favor of the hypothesis that each of these parameters was greater in the 50-59-year-old cohort. The estimated mean lead times were 0.83 years and 0.96 years if the two cohorts were screened annually. CONCLUSIONS: The increase in sensitivity corresponds to an increase in the mean sojourn time. Breast cancer in younger women is more difficult to detect by screening tests and is more aggressive than breast cancer in older women. Women aged 50-59 tend to benefit more from screening compared with women aged 40-49.;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Adult,Bayes Theorem,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology,Breast Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Canada/epidemiology,Early Detection of Cancer*,Female,Humans,Mammography*,Mass Screening*,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical*,Risk Factors,Survival Rate,P20 RR016481/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States,P30 ES014443/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States,R03 CA115012/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,R03 CA115012-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,R01 HD053509/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States,P20-RR/DE177702/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States,R03CA115012/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,P30-ES014443/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States,R01 DE018215/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States,P20RR16481/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States,R01-HD053509/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States,R01DE018215/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States;20434974;
Estimating screening test sensitivity and tumour progression using tumour size and time since previous screening.;Weedon-Fekjaer H1, Tretli S, Aalen OO.;Stat Methods Med Res. 2010 Oct.19(5):507-27. doi: 10.1177/0962280209359860. Epub 2010 Mar 31.;Abstract As mammography screening aims to improve the prognosis through earlier detection/treatment, tumour progression and screening test sensitivity (STS) represent key parameters in the evaluation of screening programs. We will here study some methods for estimation of tumour progression and STS, and show how previously used methods can be combined and developed to utilise more of the data available in modern screening programs. Weedon-Fekjaer et al. recently suggested a study design using interview data about time since previous screening to estimate tumour progression and STS in a stepwise Markov model. While useful, the approach does not utilise tumour size measurements, nor link tumour progression to tumour size. Hence, we will here propose formulas for estimating tumour progression and STS using a continuous tumour growth model. To estimate tumour progression and STS, tumour growth curves are followed from one screening to the next, and probabilities for all combinations of tumour sizes at repeated screening examinations calculated. Based on the probabilities for screening detection on subsequent screening examinations, maximum likelihood estimates are calculated. Applied to Norwegian data, the new approach gives similar results to previously published results based on interval data, confirming the earlier estimated large variation in tumour growth rates.;Disease Progression,Early Diagnosis,Humans,Markov Chains,Models, Statistical,Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Neoplasms/pathology,Norway,Probability,Sensitivity and Specificity;20356856;
Estimating the costs of cervical cancer screening in high-burden Sub-Saharan African countries.;Mvundura M1, Tsu V2.;Int J Gynaecol Obstet. 2014 Aug.126(2):151-5. doi: 10.1016/j.ijgo.2014.02.012. Epub 2014 Apr 12.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: To estimate the capital investment and recurrent costs of national cervical cancer screening and precancer treatment programs in 23 high-incidence countries in Sub-Saharan Africa in order to provide estimates of the investment required to tackle the burden of cervical cancer in this region. These 23 countries account for 64% of the annual cervical cancer deaths in this region. METHODS: Secondary data were used to estimate the financial costs of equipment purchases and economic costs of screening and treating eligible women over a 10-year period. Screening would be by visual inspection with acetic acid and treatment by cryotherapy or loop electrosurgical excision procedure. RESULTS: Approximately US $59 million would be required to purchase treatment equipment if cryotherapy were placed at every screening facility. Approximately 20 million women would be screened over 10 years. Cost per woman screened in a screen-and-treat program was either US $3.33 or US $7.31, and cost per woman treated was either US $38 or US $71 depending on the location of cryotherapy equipment. CONCLUSION: It would take less than US $10 per woman screened to significantly decrease the cervical cancer deaths that will occur in Sub-Saharan Africa over the next 10 years.

Estimating the direct costs of bowel cancer services provided by the National Health Service in England;Bending M.W., Trueman P., Lowson K.V., Pilgrim H., Tappenden P., Chilcott J., Tappenden J.;2010,International Journal of Technology Assessment in Health Care;Objectives: Bowel cancer is the second most common cancer in England and Wales, accounting for approximately 13,000 deaths per year. Economic evaluations and national guidance have been produced for individual treatments for bowel cancer. However, it has been suggested that Primary Care Trusts develop program budgeting or equivalent methodology demonstrating a whole system approach to investment and disinvestment. The objective of this study was to provide a baseline framework for considering a whole system approach to estimate the direct costs of bowel cancer services provided by the National Health Service (NHS) in England. Methods: A treatment pathway, developed in 2005, was used to construct a service pathway model to estimate the direct cost of bowel cancer services in England. Results: The service pathway model estimated the direct cost of bowel cancer services to the NHS to be in excess of 1 billion in 2005. Thirty-five percent of the cost is attributable to the screening and testing of patients with suspected bowel cancer, subsequently diagnosed as cancer-free. Conclusions: This study is believed to be the most comprehensive attempt to identify the direct cost of managing bowel cancer services in England. The approach adopted could be useful to assist local decision makers in identifying those aspects of the pathway that are most uncertain in terms of their cost-effectiveness and as a basis to explore the implications of re-allocated resources. Research recommendations include the need for detailed costs on surgical procedures, high-risk patients and the utilization of the methods used in this study across other cancers. Copyright ?

Estimation of natural history parameters of breast cancer based on non-randomized organized screening data: subsidiary analysis of effects of inter-screening interval, sensitivity, and attendance rate on reduction of advanced cancer.;;Breast Cancer Res Treat. 2010 Jul.122(2):553-66. doi: 10.1007/s10549-009-0701-x. Epub 2010 Jan 7.;Abstract Estimating the natural history parameters of breast cancer not only elucidates the disease progression but also make contributions to assessing the impact of inter-screening interval, sensitivity, and attendance rate on reducing advanced breast cancer. We applied three-state and five-state Markov models to data on a two-yearly routine mammography screening in Finland between 1988 and 2000. The mean sojourn time (MST) was computed from estimated transition parameters. Computer simulation was implemented to examine the effect of inter-screening interval, sensitivity, and attendance rate on reducing advanced breast cancers. In three-state model, the MST was 2.02 years, and the sensitivity for detecting preclinical breast cancer was 84.83%. In five-state model, the MST was 2.21 years for localized tumor and 0.82 year for non-localized tumor. Annual, biennial, and triennial screening programs can reduce 53, 37, and 28% of advanced cancer. The effectiveness of intensive screening with poor attendance is the same as that of infrequent screening with high attendance rate. We demonstrated how to estimate the natural history parameters using a service screening program and applied these parameters to assess the impact of inter-screening interval, sensitivity, and attendance rate on reducing advanced cancer. The proposed method makes contribution to further cost-effectiveness analysis. However, these findings had better be validated by using a further long-term follow-up data.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology,Breast Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Computer Simulation,Female,Finland/epidemiology,Humans,Incidence,Mammography/statistics & numerical data*,Markov Chains,Mass Screening/methods,Mass Screening/statistics & numerical data*,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical*,Patient Compliance/statistics & numerical data*,Predictive Value of Tests,Program Evaluation,Registries,Sensitivity and Specificity,Time Factors;20054645;
Evaluating lung cancer screening in China: Implications for eligibility criteria design from a microsimulation modeling approach.;Sheehan DF1, Criss SD1, Gazelle GS1,2,3, Pandharipande PV1,2, Kong CY1,2.;PLoS One. 2017 Mar 8.12(3):e0173119. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0173119. eCollection 2017.;Abstract More than half of males in China are current smokers and evidence from western countries tells us that an unprecedented number of smoking-attributable deaths will occur as the Chinese population ages. We used the China Lung Cancer Policy Model (LCPM) to simulate effects of computed tomography (CT)-based lung cancer screening in China, comparing the impact of a screening guideline published in 2015 by a Chinese expert group to a version developed for the United States by the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). The China LCPM, built using an existing lung cancer microsimulation model, can project population outcomes associated with interventions for smoking-related diseases. After calibrating the model to published Chinese smoking prevalence and lung cancer mortality rates, we simulated screening from 2016 to 2050 based on eligibility criteria from the CMS and Chinese guidelines, which differ by age to begin and end screening, pack-years smoked, and years since quitting. Outcomes included number of screens, mortality reduction, and life-years saved for each strategy. We projected that in the absence of screening, 14.98 million lung cancer deaths would occur between 2016 and 2050. Screening with the CMS guideline would prevent 0.72 million deaths and 5.8 million life-years lost, resulting in 6.58% and 1.97% mortality reduction in males and females, respectively. Screening with the Chinese guideline would prevent 0.74 million deaths and 6.6 million life-years lost, resulting in 6.30% and 2.79% mortality reduction in males and females, respectively. Through 2050, 1.43 billion screens would be required using the Chinese screening strategy, compared to 988 million screens using the CMS guideline. In conclusion, CT-based lung cancer screening implemented in 2016 and based on the Chinese screening guideline would prevent about 20,000 (2.9%) more lung cancer deaths through 2050, but would require about 445 million (44.7%) more screens than the CMS guideline.;Adolescent,Adult,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,China/epidemiology,Computer Simulation,Early Detection of Cancer,Female,Humans,Lung Neoplasms/diagnosis,Lung Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Lung Neoplasms/etiology,Lung Neoplasms/mortality,Male,Mass Screening,Middle Aged,Models, Theoretical,Population Surveillance*,Prevalence,Risk Factors,Young Adult,U01 CA199284/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;28273181;
Evaluating the age to begin periodic breast cancer screening using data from a few regularly scheduled screenings.;;Biometrics. 1998 Dec.54(4):1569-78.;Abstract To evaluate various ages to begin periodic breast cancer screening, we propose a method of analysis that can be applied to either a nonrandomized or a randomized study involving only a few screenings at regular intervals. For the analysis of data from a nonrandomized study, we assume (i) once breast cancer can be detected on screening and confirmed by biopsy, it will stay that way. (ii) given age, the probability of breast cancer detection does not depend on year of birth. and (iii) subjects who refuse screening have the same rates of breast cancer mortality following diagnosis as screened subjects had they not received screening. The key idea is that older screened subjects are controls for younger screened subjects. For the analysis of data from a randomized study, we relax assumption (iii). Based on the HIP randomized trial and assumptions (i) and (ii), we estimate that starting periodic breast cancer screening with mammography and physical examination at age 40 instead of age 50 reduces breast cancer mortality by 14 per 10,000 with a 95% confidence interval of (-4/10,000, 32/10,000). This must be weighted against an estimated increase in the number of biopsies that do not detect cancer of 580 per 10,000 with a 95% confidence interval of (520/10,000, 650/10,000).;Adult,Age Factors,Biometry/methods*,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Breast Neoplasms/mortality,Female,Humans,Mass Screening/methods,Mass Screening/statistics & numerical data*,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical,Random Allocation;9883553;
Evaluating the impacts of screening and smoking cessation programmes on lung cancer in a high-burden region of the USA: a simulation modelling study.;Tramontano AC1, Sheehan DF1, McMahon PM2, Dowling EC1, Holford TR3, Ryczak K4, Lesko SM4, Levy DT5, Kong CY2.;BMJ Open. 2016 Feb 29.6(2):e010227. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2015-010227.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: While the US Preventive Services Task Force has issued recommendations for lung cancer screening, its effectiveness at reducing lung cancer burden may vary at local levels due to regional variations in smoking behaviour. Our objective was to use an existing model to determine the impacts of lung cancer screening alone or in addition to increased smoking cessation in a US region with a relatively high smoking prevalence and lung cancer incidence. SETTING: Computer-based simulation model. PARTICIPANTS: Simulated population of individuals 55 and older based on smoking prevalence and census data from Northeast Pennsylvania. INTERVENTIONS: Hypothetical lung cancer control from 2014 to 2050 through (1) screening with CT, (2) intensified smoking cessation or (3) a combination strategy. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were lung cancer mortality rates. Secondary outcomes included number of people eligible for screening and number of radiation-induced lung cancers. RESULTS: Combining lung cancer screening with increased smoking cessation would yield an estimated 8.1% reduction in cumulative lung cancer mortality by 2050. Our model estimated that the number of screening-eligible individuals would progressively decrease over time, indicating declining benefit of a screening-only programme. Lung cancer screening achieved a greater mortality reduction in earlier years, but was later surpassed by smoking cessation. CONCLUSIONS: Combining smoking cessation programmes with lung cancer screening would provide the most benefit to a population, especially considering the growing proportion of patients ineligible for screening based on current recommendations.

Evaluation by Markov chain models of a non-randomised breast cancer screening programme in women aged under 50 years in Sweden.;;J Epidemiol Community Health. 1998 May.52(5):329-35.;Abstract STUDY OBJECTIVE: To apply Markov chain models that have previously been used on data in randomised trials of breast cancer screening to data from an uncontrolled service screening programme. to compare results with those from a randomised trial. DESIGN: A service screening programme in Uppsala county, Sweden, inviting 25,660 women aged 39-49 to mammographic screening every 20 months, and the Swedish Two-County Trial inviting 19,844 women aged 40-49 to two yearly screening, compared with 15,604 women of the same age in an unscreened control group. Data were analysed using Markov chain models and quasi-likelihood estimation procedures. MAIN RESULTS: The results with respect to parameters of disease progression were very similar between the two studies. Use of estimated progression rates to predict the effect on mortality ranged from a 10% to a 17% reduction in breast cancer mortality in the Two-County Study and predicted a 15% reduction in the Uppsala programme. These compare well with the observed mortality reduction of 13% in the Two-County Trial. CONCLUSIONS: The screening in the Uppsala programme is likely to have a similar effect to that observed in the Two-County Trial. It is feasible to evaluate non-randomised service screening programmes using Markov chain models.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Age Factors,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/mortality,Breast Neoplasms/pathology,Breast Neoplasms/prevention & control,Disease Progression,Evaluation Studies as Topic,Female,Humans,Mammography/utilization*,Markov Chains*,Mass Screening/standards*,Middle Aged,Sweden/epidemiology,Time Factors;9764285;
Evaluation of breast cancer risk assessment techniques: a cost-effectiveness analysis.;;Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2004 Dec.13(12):2043-52.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: Assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of using biomarkers and risk assessment tools to stratify women for breast cancer preventive interventions. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to compare risk management strategies for high-risk women considering chemoprevention. Annual screening is compared to the use of chemoprevention for all women and the use of risk assessment technologies to stratify patients for chemoprevention. The biomarker atypia was used to stratify women by risk. Random fine-needle aspiration (rFNA) and ductal lavage (DL) were evaluated and compared as the risk assessment tools used to discover atypia. Sensitivity analyses explore assumptions regarding the prognostic and predictive characteristics of atypia, both the relative breast cancer risk and benefit from chemoprevention women with atypia incur. RESULTS: Risk assessment strategies using rFNA or DL in combination with chemoprevention are found to be cost-effective (<$50,000 per life year saved) in high-risk groups under most scenarios. Both strategies were more effective and less costly in younger cohorts. Effectiveness of the risk assessment strategies increased when higher risk and increased benefit from chemoprevention were associated with atypia. Within the scenarios tested, rFNA is less costly than DL. CONCLUSION: rFNA and DL appear to be cost-effective in high-risk women, assuming women with detected atypia choose tamoxifen. The tools are largely effective for women who are not motivated to take tamoxifen but would be if atypia were found. As biomarker risk assessment tools better predict the risk of breast cancer and or benefit of interventions, their cost-effectiveness increases.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Aged,Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/therapeutic use,Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis*,Biopsy, Needle,Breast Neoplasms/economics*,Breast Neoplasms/etiology*,Breast Neoplasms/prevention & control,Chemoprevention,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Decision Making,Female,Humans,Markov Chains,Middle Aged,Prognosis,Risk Assessment,Sensitivity and Specificity,Survival,Tamoxifen/therapeutic use,Therapeutic Irrigation,Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal,Biomarkers, Tumor,Tamoxifen;15598759;
Evaluation of breast cancer service screening programme with a Bayesian approach: mortality analysis in a Finnish region.;;Breast Cancer Res Treat. 2010 Jun.121(3):671-8. doi: 10.1007/s10549-009-0604-x. Epub 2009 Nov 5.;Abstract Evaluation of long-term effectiveness of population-based breast cancer service screening program in a small geographic area may suffer from self-selection bias and small samples. Under a prospective cohort design with exposed and non-exposed groups classified by whether women attended the screen upon invitation, we proposed a Bayesian acyclic graphic model for correcting self-selection bias with or without incorporation of prior information derived from previous studies with an identical screening program in Sweden by chronological order and applied it to an organized breast cancer service screening program in Pirkanmaa center of Finland. The relative mortality rate of breast cancer was 0.27 (95% CI 0.12-0.61) for the exposed group versus the non-exposed group without adjusting for self-selection bias. With adjustment for selection-bias, the adjusted relative mortality rate without using previous data was 0.76 (95% CI 0.49-1.15), whereas a statistically significant result was achieved [0.73 (95% CI 0.57-0.93)] with incorporation of previous information. With the incorporation of external data sources from Sweden in chronological order, adjusted relative mortality rate was 0.67 (0.55-0.80). We demonstrated how to apply a Bayesian acyclic graphic model with self-selection bias adjustment to evaluating an organized but non-randomized breast cancer screening program in a small geographic area with a significant 27% mortality reduction that is consistent with the previous result but more precise. Around 33% mortality was estimated by taking previous randomized controlled data from Sweden.;Multicenter Study,Bayes Theorem,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology,Breast Neoplasms/mortality*,Breast Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Cohort Studies,Female,Finland/epidemiology,Humans,Incidence,Likelihood Functions,Mass Screening*,Middle Aged,Outcome Assessment (Health Care)/statistics & numerical data*,Prospective Studies,Selection Bias,Small-Area Analysis,Survival Rate;19890708;
Evaluation of health benefits and harms of the breast cancer screening programme in the Basque Country using discrete event simulation.;Arrospide A1,2,3, Rue M4,5, van Ravesteyn NT6, Comas M7,8, Larraƒ?aga N9,10, Sarriugarte G11, Mar J12,13,14,15.;BMC Cancer. 2015 Oct 12.15:671. doi: 10.1186/s12885-015-1700-4.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Since the breast cancer screening programme in the Basque Country (BCSPBC) was started in 1996, more than 400,000 women aged 50 to 69 years have been invited to participate. Based on epidemiological observations and simulation techniques it is possible to extend observed short term data into anticipated long term results. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of the programme through 2011 by quantifying the outcomes in breast cancer mortality, life-years gained, false positive results, and overdiagnosis. METHODS: A discrete event simulation model was constructed to reproduce the natural history of breast cancer (disease-free, pre-clinical, symptomatic, and disease-specific death) and the actual observed characteristics of the screening programme during the evaluated period in the Basque women population. Goodness-of-fit statistics were applied for model validation. The screening effects were measured as differences in benefits and harms between the screened and unscreened populations. Breast cancer mortality reduction and life-years gained were considered as screening benefits, whereas, overdiagnosis and false positive results were assessed as harms. Results for a single cohort were also obtained. RESULTS: The screening programme yielded a 16 % reduction in breast cancer mortality and a 10 % increase in the incidence of breast cancer through 2011. Almost 2 % of all the women in the programme had a false positive result during the evaluation period. When a single cohort was analysed, the number of deaths decreased by 13 %, and 4 % of screen-detected cancers were overdiagnosed. Each woman with BC detected by the screening programme gained 2.5 life years due to early detection corrected by lead time. CONCLUSIONS: Fifteen years after the screening programme started, this study supports an important decrease in breast cancer mortality due to the screening programme, with reasonable risk of overdiagnosis and false positive results, and sustains the continuation of the breast cancer screening programme in the Basque population.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Aged,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Female,Humans,Incidence,Mass Screening*/methods,Middle Aged,Mortality,Registries,Risk Assessment;26459293;

Evidence-based policy choices for efficient and equitable cervical cancer screening programs in low-resource settings.;;Cancer Med. 2017 Aug.6(8):2008-2014. doi: 10.1002/cam4.1123. Epub 2017 Jul 14.;Abstract Women in developing countries disproportionately bear the burden of cervical cancer. The availability of prophylactic vaccines against human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18, which cause approximately 70% of cervical cancers, provides reason for optimism as roll-out begins with support from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. However, for the hundreds of millions of women beyond the target age for HPV vaccination, cervical cancer screening to detect and treat precancerous lesions remains the only form of prevention. Here we describe the challenges that confront screening programs in low-resource settings, including (1) optimizing screening test effectiveness. (2) achieving high screening coverage of the target population. and (3) managing screen-positive women. For each of these challenges, we summarize the tradeoffs between resource utilization and programmatic attributes. We then highlight opportunities for efficient and equitable programming, with supporting evidence from recent mathematical modeling analyses informed by data from the PATH demonstration projects in India, Nicaragua, and Uganda.;Choice Behavior*,Computer Simulation,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Developing Countries,Disease Management,Early Detection of Cancer*,Female,Health Policy*,Health Resources*,Humans,Mass Screening,Models, Theoretical,Papillomavirus Infections/complications,Papillomavirus Infections/diagnosis,Papillomavirus Infections/epidemiology,Papillomavirus Infections/virology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/etiology;28707435;

Expenditure and resource utilisation for cervical screening in Australia.;;BMC Health Serv Res. 2012 Dec 5.12:446. doi: 10.1186/1472-6963-12-446.;Abstract BACKGROUND: The National Cervical Screening Program in Australia currently recommends that women aged 18-69 years are screened with conventional cytology every 2 years. Publicly funded HPV vaccination was introduced in 2007, and partly as a consequence, a renewal of the screening program that includes a review of screening recommendations has recently been announced. This study aimed to provide a baseline for such a review by quantifying screening program resource utilisation and costs in 2010. METHODS: A detailed model of current cervical screening practice in Australia was constructed and we used data from the Victorian Cervical Cytology Registry to model age-specific compliance with screening and follow-up. We applied model-derived rate estimates to the 2010 Australian female population to calculate costs and numbers of colposcopies, biopsies, treatments for precancer and cervical cancers in that year, assuming that the numbers of these procedures were not yet substantially impacted by vaccination. RESULTS: The total cost of the screening program in 2010 (excluding administrative program overheads) was estimated to be A$194.8M. We estimated that a total of 1.7 million primary screening smears costing $96.7M were conducted, a further 188,900 smears costing $10.9M were conducted to follow-up low grade abnormalities, 70,900 colposcopy and 34,100 histological evaluations together costing $21.2M were conducted, and about 18,900 treatments for precancerous lesions were performed (including retreatments), associated with a cost of $45.5M for treatment and post-treatment follow-up. We also estimated that $20.5M was spent on work-up and treatment for approximately 761 women diagnosed with invasive cervical cancer. Overall, an estimated $23 was spent in 2010 for each adult woman in Australia on cervical screening program-related activities. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately half of the total cost of the screening program is spent on delivery of primary screening tests. but the introduction of HPV vaccination, new technologies, increasing the interval and changing the age range of screening is expected to have a substantial impact on this expenditure, as well as having some impact on follow-up and management costs. These estimates provide a benchmark for future assessment of the impact of changes to screening program recommendations to the costs of cervical screening in Australia.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adolescent,Adult,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Cytological Techniques/economics,Cytological Techniques/utilization,Female,Health Resources/economics,Health Resources/utilization,Human papillomavirus 16/isolation & purification,Humans,Immunization Programs/economics,Immunization Programs/organization & administration,Markov Chains,Mass Screening/economics*,Mass Screening/utilization*,Middle Aged,Models, Economic,Registries,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/mortality,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/pathology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Victoria/epidemiology,Young Adult;23216968;

Faecal occult blood screening for colorectal cancer: is it cost-effective?;;Health Econ. 1998 Feb.7(1):21-9.;Abstract Recently published evidence from two large-scale clinical trials conducted in England and in Denmark suggests that faecal occult blood screening for colorectal cancer significantly reduces mortality. However, before screening can be advocated as part of national health policy, its cost-effectiveness must be demonstrated. The English screening trial has been the subject of a detailed economic evaluation over the past 10 years In this paper, cost-effectiveness estimates of screening are presented, based on cost and outcome data combined in a mathematical model developed from the trial's clinical findings The estimates of cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained from colorectal cancer screening show the procedure to be of similar cost-effectiveness to breast cancer screening in the short term. Over the longer term, however, the estimates for colorectal cancer screening appear superior.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Aged,Colorectal Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Computer Simulation,Cost-Benefit Analysis,England,Female,Humans,Male,Mass Screening/economics*,Middle Aged,Models, Econometric,Occult Blood*,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,Survival Rate;9541081;
Faecal occult blood testing in areas of high incidence and mortality. the effect of screening the population aged 50 to 59.;Fisher R1, Rooney PS.;Colorectal Dis. 2011 Sep.13(9):1024-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1463-1318.2010.02374.x. Epub 2010 Jul 9.;Abstract AIM: In central Liverpool, the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) is 119% of the national average. Currently, screening is offered to those aged 60-70 through the National Bowel Cancer screening programme. A theoretical model showing the effect of the introduction of biennial screening in individuals aged 50-59 has been applied to the population of central Liverpool. METHOD: The impact of screening using faecal occult blood testing (FOBT) in individuals aged 50-59 in central Liverpool (n = 47,440. males 23,312) was assessed by a model based on three levels of compliance. RESULTS: After modelling, the positive FOBT result for increased incidence of CRC, the positive predictive value for adenoma and cancer detection was calculated using age-specific positivity rates. The results indicate that between 120 and 162 new diagnoses of CRC per 100,000 population aged 50-59 could be detected by biennial screening, dependent on compliance rates. CONCLUSION: Screening individuals aged 50-59 can identify early cancers and significant adenomas, which may contribute to a reduction in the expected high mortality rate found in this geographical area. ‚? 2011 The Authors.

Harms, benefits and costs of fecal immunochemical testing versus guaiac fecal occult blood testing for colorectal cancer screening.;;PLoS One. 2017 Mar 15.12(3):e0172864. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0172864. eCollection 2017.;Abstract BACKGROUND: The ColonCancerCheck screening program for colorectal cancer (CRC) in Ontario, Canada, is considering switching from biennial guaiac fecal occult blood test (gFOBT) screening between age 50-74 years to the more sensitive, but also less specific fecal immunochemical test (FIT). The aim of this study is to estimate whether the additional benefits of FIT screening compared to gFOBT outweigh the additional costs and harms. METHODS: We used microsimulation modeling to estimate quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained and costs of gFOBT and FIT, compared to no screening, in a cohort of screening participants. We compared strategies with various age ranges, screening intervals, and cut-off levels for FIT. Cost-efficient strategies were determined for various levels of available colonoscopy capacity. RESULTS: Compared to no screening, biennial gFOBT screening between age 50-74 years provided 20 QALYs at a cost of CAN$200,900 per 1,000 participants, and required 17 colonoscopies per 1,000 participants per year. FIT screening was more effective and less costly. For the same level of colonoscopy requirement, biennial FIT (with a high cut-off level of 200 ng Hb/ml) between age 50-74 years provided 11 extra QALYs gained while saving CAN$333,300 per 1000 participants, compared to gFOBT. Without restrictions in colonoscopy capacity, FIT (with a low cut-off level of 50 ng Hb/ml) every year between age 45-80 years was the most cost-effective strategy providing 27 extra QALYs gained per 1000 participants, while saving CAN$448,300. INTERPRETATION: Compared to gFOBT screening, switching to FIT at a high cut-off level could increase the health benefits of a CRC screening program without considerably increasing colonoscopy demand.;Colorectal Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Feces*,Guaiac,Humans,Immunochemistry,Occult Blood*,Quality of Life,Guaiac,P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,U01 CA199335/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;28296927;
Health care costs for state transition models in prostate cancer;Krahn M.D., Bremner K.E., Zagorski B., Alibhai S.M.H., Chen W., Tomlinson G., Mitsakakis N., Naglie G.;2014,Medical Decision Making;Objective. To obtain estimates of direct health care costs for prostate cancer (PC) from diagnosis to death to inform state transition models. Methods. A stratified random sample of PC patients residing in 3 geographically diverse regions of Ontario, Canada, and diagnosed in 1993-1994, 1997-1998, and 2001-2002, was selected from the Ontario Cancer Registry. We retrieved patients' pathology reports to identify referring physicians and contacted surviving patients and next of kin of deceased patients for informed consent. We reviewed clinic charts to obtain data required to allocate each patient's observation time to 11 PC-specific health states. We linked these data to health care administrative databases to calculate resource use and costs (Canadian dollars, 2008) per health state. A multivariable mixed-effects model determined predictors of costs. Results. The final sample numbered 829 patients. In the regression model, total direct costs increased with age, comorbidity, and Gleason score (all P < 0.0001). Radical prostatectomy was the most costly primary treatment health state ($4676 per 100 days). Radical prostatectomy, hormone-refractory metastatic disease ($6398 per 100 days), and final (predeath) ($13,739 per 100 days) health states were significantly more costly (P < 0.05) than nontreated nonmetastatic PC ($3440 per 100 days), whereas the postprostatectomy ($732 per 100 days) and postradiation ($1556 per 100 days) states cost significantly less (P < 0.0001). Conclusions. This study used an innovative but labor-intensive approach linking chart and administrative data to estimate health care costs. Researchers should weigh the potential benefits of this method against what is involved in implementation. Modifications in methodology may achieve similar gains with less outlay in individual studies. However, we believe that this is a promising approach for researchers wishing to advance the quality of costing in state transition modeling. ?

High participation rates are not necessary for cost-effective colorectal cancer screening.;Howard K1, Salkeld G, Irwig L, Adelstein BA.;J Med Screen. 2005.12(2):96-102.;"Abstract BACKGROUND: In many countries high participation is an explicit target in screening programmes. The desire for high participation often appears to drive screening policy, although it is increasingly recognized that encouraging high participation may impinge upon the rights of an individual to make an informed choice. One argument offered in support of high participation is that it improves the cost-effectiveness of screening. This is questionable on theoretical grounds, and empirically there are conflicting results. Two recent cost-effectiveness models of faecal occult blood test (FOBT) screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) showed that cost-effectiveness was improved, another showed that cost-effectiveness was worsened and a fourth indicated that cost-effectiveness was unaffected by increasing the participation rate. METHODS: We assessed the extent to which different levels and patterns of participation affect cost-effectiveness, using decision modelling of three CRC screening with FOBT scenarios. We estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness (value for money) ratios for each scenario. RESULTS: The way in which participation is modelled, particularly assumptions made about the subsequent screening behaviour of non-participants (""if"" and ""when"" a non-participant attends for subsequent screening), affects the cost-effectiveness estimates for FOBT screening programmes. 100% participation in all screening rounds gives a cost per life year saved (LYS) of USD 9705. Cost-effectiveness is worst when people who do not take part in one screening round (initial or subsequent) never take part in any future rounds of screening. Under this scenario, a participation rate of 20% in second and subsequent rounds gives a cost per LYS of USD 29,500. Under more realistic assumptions, for example the attendance of even a small proportion of non-participants in subsequent rounds, cost-effectiveness is more favourable and similar to that achieved for full participation: the scenario with a random participation rate of 20% in second and subsequent rounds for both participants and non-participants has a cost per LYS of USD 11,270. CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to a commonly held view, high participation in screening programmes is not necessary to achieve cost-effectiveness. Setting high target participation rates in screening programmes does not guarantee cost-effectiveness and may in certain circumstances reduce the cost-effectiveness.";Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Colorectal Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Costs and Cost Analysis,Feces,Humans,Markov Chains,Mass Screening/economics*,Mass Screening/methods*,Middle Aged,Models, Econometric,Models, Theoretical,Occult Blood,Sensitivity and Specificity;15949121;

HPV testing for cervical cancer screening appears more cost-effective than Papanicolau cytology in Mexico;Flores Y.N., Bishai D.M., Lorincz A., Shah K.V., Lazcano-Ponce E., Hernandez M., Granados-Garcia V., Perez R., Salmeron J.;2011,Cancer Causes and Control;Objective: To determine the incremental costs and effects of different HPV testing strategies, when compared to Papanicolau cytology (Pap), for cervical cancer screening in Mexico. Methods: A cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) examined the specific costs and health outcomes associated with (1) no screening, (2) only the Pap test, (3) only self-administered HPV, (4) only clinician administered HPV, and (5) clinician administered HPV plus the Pap test. The costs of self- and clinician-HPV testing, as well as with the Pap test, were identified and quantified. Costs were reported in 2008 US dollars. The health outcome associated with these screening strategies was defined as the number of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or cervical cancer cases detected. This CEA was performed using the perspective of the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) in Morelos, Mexico. Results: Screening women between the ages of 30-80 for cervical cancer using clinical-HPV testing or the combination of clinical-HPV testing, and the Pap is always more cost-effective than using the Pap test alone. Conclusions: This CEA indicates that HPV testing could be a cost-effective screening alternative for a large health delivery organization such as IMSS. These results may help policy-makers implement HPV testing as part of the IMSS cervical cancer screening program. ? 2010 The Author(s).;Cervical cancer, Cost-effectiveness, HPV, Mexico, Screening;;
Human papillomavirus testing with Pap triage for cervical cancer prevention in Canada: a cost-effectiveness analysis.;;BMC Med. 2009 Nov 9.7:69. doi: 10.1186/1741-7015-7-69.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Recently published results from a large randomized trial (Canadian Cervical Cancer Screening Trial study group) suggest that human papillomavirus testing followed by Pap smear-based triage for human papillomavirus positive women may be an effective way to screen women for cervical cancer. We determined the potential cost-effectiveness of including human papillomavirus tests for cervical cancer screening for Canada and three provinces: Alberta, Newfoundland and Ontario. METHODS: We developed four Markov decision models using data from relevant Canadian and provincial studies and databases. The models were used to determine the number of false positive test results, cancers, lifetime costs and life-expectancy for 27 different screening strategies that varied by age to begin screening (18 or 25 years), screening interval ( two, three, or five years) and whether the currently recommended strategy (screening every year from age 18 until 21 and then every three years afterwards with conventional Paps) was conducted prior to age 25. Strategies were compared using incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: Screening strategies beginning at age 18 were associated with a substantial increase in the number of false-positive test results but only small differences in the number of cancers compared to the same strategy conducted beginning at age 25. Strategies of human papillomavirus testing first, followed by triage with Pap smears were associated with lower costs and greater increases in life-expectancy than the currently recommended screening strategy in Canada. CONCLUSION: A strategy of human papillomavirus testing beginning at age 25, with Pap triage for women with positive human papillomavirus results may be more effective at reducing cervical cancer at a lower cost than the current recommended strategy for screening in Canada.;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adolescent,Adult,Alberta,Cervix Uteri/pathology*,Cervix Uteri/virology*,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Female,Humans,Mass Screening/methods*,Newfoundland and Labrador,Ontario,Papanicolaou Test*,Papillomavirus Infections/diagnosis*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/economics*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/virology,Vaginal Smears/economics*,Young Adult,014033/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada,1K07-CA113773/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,83320/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada;19900264;
Impact of HPV sample self-collection for underscreened women in the renewed Cervical Screening Program.;;Med J Aust. 2016 Mar 21.204(5):1941e-7.;Abstract OBJECTIVES: In 2017, the National Cervical Screening Program in Australia will transition to 5-yearly primary HPV screening for all women, irrespective of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination status. As an adjunct to the mainstream program, HPV testing on self-collected samples will be offered under practitioner supervision to all unscreened and underscreened women aged 30-74 years. We quantified how different screening decisions affect the future risk of cervical cancer. DESIGN: Simulation of outcomes for 100 000 previously unscreened women, aged 30 years and eligible for self-collection, using a well-established model of HPV natural history and cervical screening. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cumulative cancer diagnoses and deaths averted (compared with remaining unscreened) to age 84, number needed to treat for pre-cancer (NNT) to avert each cancer diagnosis. RESULTS: One round of self-collected HPV screening at age 30 years would avert 908 cancer diagnoses and 364 cancer deaths in the cohort by age 84 (NNT, 5.8). Benefits would still be achieved were self-collected screening delayed to age 40 (922 fewer diagnoses. 426 fewer deaths. NNT, 3.7) or 50 (684 fewer diagnoses. 385 fewer deaths. NNT, 3.2). However, the benefits associated with joining the mainstream screening program would be substantially larger (2002, 1623 or 1091 fewer diagnoses and NNT of 4.9, 3.7 or 3.4 by joining at age 30, 40 or 50 years respectively). The relative benefits of joining the mainstream program were similar for cohorts who had been offered vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Offering HPV self-collection has the potential to considerably improve outcomes for unscreened and underscreened women. Nevertheless, these findings underscore the need for concerted strategies to encourage these women to join the mainstream HPV screening program.;Adult,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Australia,Cause of Death,Female,Humans,Mass Screening/organization & administration*,Middle Aged,Papillomaviridae*,Papillomavirus Infections/diagnosis*,Papillomavirus Infections/mortality,Papillomavirus Infections/prevention & control*,Self-Examination/methods*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Vaginal Smears/methods*,Vulnerable Populations*;26985849;
Impact of risk factors on different interval cancer subtypes in a population-based breast cancer screening programme.;Blanch J1, Sala M2, Ibƒöƒ?ez J3, Domingo L4, Fernandez B5, Otegi A6, Barata T7, Zubizarreta R5, Ferrer J8, Castells X2, Ruƒ?

INCA Study Group.;PLoS One. 2014 Oct 21.9(10):e110207. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0110207. eCollection 2014.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Interval cancers are primary breast cancers diagnosed in women after a negative screening test and before the next screening invitation. Our aim was to evaluate risk factors for interval cancer and their subtypes and to compare the risk factors identified with those associated with incident screen-detected cancers. METHODS: We analyzed data from 645,764 women participating in the Spanish breast cancer screening program from 2000-2006 and followed-up until 2009. A total of 5,309 screen-detected and 1,653 interval cancers were diagnosed. Among the latter, 1,012 could be classified on the basis of findings in screening and diagnostic mammograms, consisting of 489 true interval cancers (48.2%), 235 false-negatives (23.2%), 172 minimal-signs (17.2%) and 114 occult tumors (11.3%). Information on the screening protocol and women's characteristics were obtained from the screening program registry. Cause-specific Cox regression models were used to estimate the hazard ratios (HR) of risks factors for interval cancer and incident screen-detected cancer. A multinomial regression model, using screen-detected tumors as a reference group, was used to assess the effect of breast density and other factors on the occurrence of interval cancer subtypes. RESULTS: A previous false-positive was the main risk factor for interval cancer (HR¢??=¢??2.71, 95%CI: 2.28-3.23). this risk was higher for false-negatives (HR¢??=¢??8.79, 95%CI: 6.24-12.40) than for true interval cancer (HR¢??=¢??2.26, 95%CI: 1.59-3.21). A family history of breast cancer was associated with true intervals (HR¢??=¢??2.11, 95%CI: 1.60-2.78), previous benign biopsy with a false-negatives (HR¢??=¢??1.83, 95%CI: 1.23-2.71). High breast density was mainly associated with occult tumors (RRR¢??=¢??4.92, 95%CI: 2.58-9.38), followed by true intervals (RRR¢??=¢??1.67, 95%CI: 1.18-2.36) and false-negatives (RRR¢??=¢??1.58, 95%CI: 1.00-2.49). CONCLUSION: The role of women's characteristics differs among interval cancer subtypes. This information could be useful to improve effectiveness of breast cancer screening programmes and to better classify subgroups of women with different risks of developing cancer.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Aged,Breast Neoplasms/classification,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/pathology,Early Detection of Cancer,False Negative Reactions,Female,Follow-Up Studies,Humans,Mammography,Mass Screening,Middle Aged,Proportional Hazards Models,Risk Factors;25333936;
Impact of systematic false-negative test results on the performance of faecal occult blood screening.;;Eur J Cancer. 2001 May.37(7):912-7.;Abstract The impact of systematic false-negative test results on mortality reduction and on programme sensitivity of annual faecal occult blood testing in ages 50-84 years is explored using a microsimulation model. We made calculations for test sensitivities of 80, 50 and 30%. In order to reproduce a cancer detection rate of 2.2 per 1000 at the first screening, the corresponding mean preclinical sojourn times had to be 1.42, 2.30 and 3.84 years, respectively. The fraction systematic results among the false-negative results is varied between 0 and 100%. With 80% test sensitivity, the reduction in mortality due to screening decreases from 25% without systematic results to 23% when all false-negative results are systematic and the programme sensitivity decreases from 63 to 58%. With 30% test sensitivity, mortality reduction decreases from 21 to 11% and programme sensitivity decreases from 52 to 27%. The impact of systematic false-negative test results is important if annual FOBT screening is considered.;Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Colorectal Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Computer Simulation,False Negative Reactions,Humans,Mass Screening/methods,Mass Screening/standards*,Middle Aged,Occult Blood*,Sensitivity and Specificity,N01-55186/PHS HHS/United States;11313180;
Impact of whole-body CT screening on the cost-effectiveness of CT colonography.;Hassan C1, Pickhardt PJ, Laghi A, Zullo A, Kim DH, Iafrate F, Di Giulio L, Morini S.;Radiology. 2009 Apr.251(1):156-65. doi: 10.1148/radiol.2511080590.;Abstract PURPOSE: To analyze the impact of adding computed tomographic (CT) imaging of the chest on the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of CT colonography to determine whether performing CT colonography and whole-body CT is a more clinically and cost-effective strategy than CT colonography alone when screening average-risk subjects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov model simulated the occurrence of colorectal neoplasia, extracolonic abominal-pelvic malignancy, lung cancer, coronary artery disease (CAD), and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in a cohort of 100,000 U.S. subjects aged 50 to 100 years. Cost-effectiveness of CT colonography and whole-body CT was compared with that of CT colonography alone. each test was assumed to be repeated every 10 years between ages of 50 and 80 years. RESULTS: Performing CT colonography and whole-body CT was more effective and costly than was CT colonography alone. The addition of chest CT was associated with a 22% increase in efficacy (life-years gained: 14,662 vs 11,990) and with a 48% increase in cost per person ($13,605 vs $9,223). Both strategies were cost effective as compared with no screening, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $17,672 (CT colonography alone) and $44,337 (CT colonography and whole-body CT), respectively, but performing CT colonography and whole-body CT was not a cost-effective option when compared with CT colonography alone (ICER, $164,020). This was mainly a result of the high cost of false-positive follow-up for CAD and to the poor efficacy of lung cancer screening. Expected value of perfect information was $520 per patient. CONCLUSION: The addition of chest CT to CT colonography does not appear to be a cost-effective alternative. Further research is needed before whole-body CT can be recommended in clinical practice.;Colonography, Computed Tomographic/economics*,Computer Simulation,Cost-Benefit Analysis/economics*,Health Care Costs/statistics & numerical data*,Humans,Mass Screening/economics*,Models, Economic*,Radiography, Thoracic/statistics & numerical data*,Tomography, X-Ray Computed,United States,Whole Body Imaging/economics*;19332851;
Improving the NHS cervical screening laboratory performance indicators by making allowance for population age, risk and screening interval.;Blanks RG1, Moss SM, Denton K.;Cytopathology. 2006 Dec.17(6):323-38.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: One of the key performance measures in the monitoring of the NHS cervical screening programme is the targeting of laboratories with very high or low percentages (outside the 10th-90th percentile) of adequate smears that have moderate dyskaryosis or worse. These laboratories are assumed to include those laboratories that may have extremes of sensitivity and specificity. A clear limitation with this methodology is that laboratories do not examine smears from women with the same underlying risk, age distribution or screening interval and adjustment for these factors should considerably improve the method. METHODS: This paper describes a method that allows for these confounding variables and a new age-risk-interval adjusted moderate dyskaryosis or worse rate (ARI-adjusted mod+ rate) can be calculated. The adjusted rate is the rate of moderate or worse dyskaryotic smears that the laboratory would have detected had it been screening women with an English 'average' age-risk-interval. All laboratories can therefore be compared using this method. RESULTS: The methodology is illustrated using data from the NHSCSP South West Region. The particularly low percentage of moderate or worse smears detected by one or two laboratories can be shown to be due to a local screened population with a very low risk because of a high mean age, relatively short screening interval and census variables associated with a low risk, rather than any under-calling by the associated laboratories. CONCLUSIONS: The ARI-adjusted mod+ rate requires to be calculated for all laboratories in England if it is to be used as a primary performance indicator. Alternatively, it can be used to further examine laboratories that are deemed to be outliers using the current methodology.;Adult,Age Factors,Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/diagnosis*,Female,Humans,Mass Screening/methods,Mass Screening/standards,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical,Risk Factors,State Medicine,United Kingdom,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Vaginal Smears/methods*,Vaginal Smears/standards*;17168915;
Incremental net benefit and acceptability of alternative health policies: a case study of mass screening for colorectal cancer.;Chauvin P1, Josselin JM, Heresbach D.;Eur J Health Econ. 2012 Jun.13(3):237-50. doi: 10.1007/s10198-011-0300-8. Epub 2011 Feb 9.;Abstract The incremental net benefit (INB) and the related acceptability curves for public health programs provide valuable tools for decision making. We proposed to apply them to the assessment of mass screening of colorectal cancer. The now standard guaiac fecal occult blood test (FOBT) is already implemented in several countries. We considered the innovative immunological FOBT and computed tomography colonography (CTC) as competing screening technologies. Using biennial guaiac FOBT as the reference strategy, we estimated the cost-effectiveness of the following alternatives: biennial immunological FOBT, CTC every 5 years (strategy CTC5), and CTC every 10 years (strategy CTC10). Over a 30-year horizon and from the perspective of a third-party payer, we developed a Markov model on a hypothetical cohort of 100,000 subjects at average risk of colorectal cancer. Close expected net benefits between immunological FOBT and CTC5 induced uncertainty in the choice of the optimal strategy. Probabilistic sensibility analysis then suggested that below a willingness to pay (WTP) per life-years gained (LYG) of 8,587 ¢??/LYG, CTC10 was optimal, while CTC5 would be preferred beyond a WTP of 8,587 ¢??/LYG.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Colorectal Neoplasms/diagnosis,Colorectal Neoplasms/economics*,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Decision Making*,Early Detection of Cancer/economics*,Female,France,Health Policy*,Health Status Indicators,Humans,Male,Markov Chains,Middle Aged,Models, Economic,Occult Blood*,Patient Satisfaction,Prevalence,Probability,Public Health/economics*,Risk Assessment/economics,Tomography, X-Ray Computed/economics;21305335;

Epub 2015 Aug 16.;Abstract This paper develops a model for cancer screening and cancer incidence data, accommodating the partially unobserved disease status, clustered data structures, general covariate effects, and dependence between exams. The true unobserved cancer and detection status of screening participants are treated as latent variables, and a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm is used to estimate the Bayesian posterior distributions of the diagnostic error rates and disease prevalence. We show how the Bayesian approach can be used to draw inferences about screening exam properties and disease prevalence while allowing for the possibility of conditional dependence between two exams. The techniques are applied to the estimation of the diagnostic accuracy of mammography and clinical breast examination using data from the Ontario Breast Screening Program in Canada.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Algorithms,Bayes Theorem,Biostatistics,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis,Computer Simulation,Early Detection of Cancer/statistics & numerical data*,Female,Humans,Mammography,Markov Chains,Models, Statistical,Monte Carlo Method,Odds Ratio,Ontario,Predictive Value of Tests,Probability;26278587;
Interval fecal immunochemical testing in a colonoscopic surveillance program speeds detection of colorectal neoplasia.;Lane JM1, Chow E, Young GP, Good N, Smith A, Bull J, Sandford J, Morcom J, Bampton PA, Cole SR.;Gastroenterology. 2010 Dec.139(6):1918-26. doi: 10.1053/j.gastro.2010.08.005. Epub 2010 Aug 16.;Abstract BACKGROUND & AIMS: Rapidly progressing or missed lesions can reduce the effectiveness of colonoscopy-based colorectal cancer surveillance programs. We investigated whether giving fecal immunochemical tests (FITs) for hemoglobin between surveillance colonoscopies resulted in earlier detection of neoplasia. METHODS: The study included 1736 patients with a family history or past neoplasia. they received at least 2 colonoscopy examinations and were followed for a total of 8863 years. Patients were excluded from the study if they had genetic syndromes, colorectal surgery, or inflammatory bowel disease. An FIT was offered yearly, in the interval between colonoscopies. if results were positive, the colonoscopy was performed earlier than scheduled. RESULTS: Among the 1071 asymptomatic subjects (61%) who received at least 1 FIT, the test detected 12 of 14 cancers (86% sensitivity) and 60 of 96 (63%) advanced adenomas. In patients with positive results from the FIT, the diagnosis of cancer was made 25 months (median) earlier and diagnosis of advanced adenoma 24 months earlier. Patients who had repeated negative results from FIT had an almost 2-fold decrease in risk for cancer and advanced adenoma compared with patients who were not tested (5.5% vs 10.1%, respectively, P = .0004). The most advanced stages of neoplasia, observed across the continuum from nonadvanced adenoma to late-stage cancer, were associated with age (increased with age), sex (increased in males), and FIT result. The probability of most advanced neoplastic stage was lowest among those with a negative result from the FIT (odds ratio, 0.68. P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Interval examinations using the FIT detected neoplasias sooner than scheduled surveillances. Subjects with negative results from the FIT had the lowest risk for the most advanced stage of neoplasia. Interval FIT analyses can be used to detect missed or rapidly developing lesions in surveillance programs. Copyright ¯õ? 2010 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Investigation of design and bias issues in case-control studies of cancer screening using microsimulation.;;Am J Epidemiol. 2000 May 15.151(10):991-8.;"Abstract Using a microsimulation approach, the authors examined design and bias issues in case-control studies of cancer screening. Specifically, they looked at the impact on the odds ratio of the way in which exposure to screening is defined, the type of age matching, the time scale used, and the criteria used to determine control eligibility. The results showed that defining exposure as ""ever/never"" screened produced, as expected, a serious bias in favor of screening. Defining exposure as being screened no later than the time the case's cancer is diagnosed has a serious bias against screening. An alternative exposure definition--screening can occur no later than the time the case would have been clinically diagnosed--eliminates the bias against screening. Further, the results showed that the type of age matching and the time scale used can produce a bias against screening and that this bias can be quite strong when case-control studies are performed in populations with a periodic screening program that is the only source of screening. Finally, control eligibility criteria had little effect.";Age Distribution,Aged,Bias*,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/etiology,Breast Neoplasms/mortality*,Case-Control Studies*,Computer Simulation*,Data Interpretation, Statistical,Environmental Exposure/adverse effects,Environmental Exposure/analysis,Epidemiologic Research Design*,Female,Humans,Mass Screening/standards*,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical*,Odds Ratio,Reproducibility of Results,Survival Analysis,Time Factors;10853638;
Korean Risk Assessment Model for Breast Cancer Risk Prediction;Park B., Ma S.H., Shin A., Chang M.-C., Choi J.-Y., Kim S., Han W., Noh D.-Y., Ahn S.-H., Kang D., Yoo K.-Y., Park S.K.;2013,PLoS ONE;Purpose:We evaluated the performance of the Gail model for a Korean population and developed a Korean breast cancer risk assessment tool (KoBCRAT) based upon equations developed for the Gail model for predicting breast cancer risk.Methods:Using 3,789 sets of cases and controls, risk factors for breast cancer among Koreans were identified. Individual probabilities were projected using Gail's equations and Korean hazard data. We compared the 5-year and lifetime risk produced using the modified Gail model which applied Korean incidence and mortality data and the parameter estimators from the original Gail model with those produced using the KoBCRAT. We validated the KoBCRAT based on the expected/observed breast cancer incidence and area under the curve (AUC) using two Korean cohorts: the Korean Multicenter Cancer Cohort (KMCC) and National Cancer Center (NCC) cohort.Results:The major risk factors under the age of 50 were family history, age at menarche, age at first full-term pregnancy, menopausal status, breastfeeding duration, oral contraceptive usage, and exercise, while those at and over the age of 50 were family history, age at menarche, age at menopause, pregnancy experience, body mass index, oral contraceptive usage, and exercise. The modified Gail model produced lower 5-year risk for the cases than for the controls (p = 0.017), while the KoBCRAT produced higher 5-year and lifetime risk for the cases than for the controls (p<0.001 and <0.001, respectively). The observed incidence of breast cancer in the two cohorts was similar to the expected incidence from the KoBCRAT (KMCC, p = 0.880, NCC, p = 0.878). The AUC using the KoBCRAT was 0.61 for the KMCC and 0.89 for the NCC cohort.Conclusions:Our findings suggest that the KoBCRAT is a better tool for predicting the risk of breast cancer in Korean women, especially urban women. ? 2013 Park et al.;,oral contraceptive agent, adult, aged, analytical parameters, article, Asian, body mass, breast cancer, breast feeding, cancer center, cancer incidence, cancer mortality, cancer prognosis, cancer risk, cohort analysis, controlled study, drug use, exercise, family history, female, Gail model, gestational age, human, human tissue, Korean, lifespan, major clinical study, mathematical model, menarche, menopause, onset age, population research, prediction, probability, risk assessment, risk factor, validation process, Adolescent, Adult, Age Factors, Aged, 80 and over, Asian Continental Ancestry Group, Breast Neoplasms, Case-Control Studies, Cohort Studies, Female, Humans, Incidence, Middle Aged, Models, Statistical, Republic of Korea, Risk Assessment, Risk Factors, Young Adult;;
Lifetime costs of colon and rectal cancer management in Canada;Maroun J., Ng E., Berthelot J.-M., Le Petit C., Dahrouge S., Flanagan W.M., Walker H., Evans W.K.;2003,Chronic Diseases in Canada;Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality among Canadians. We derived the direct health care costs associated with the lifetime management of an estimated 16,856 patients with a diagnosis of colon and rectal cancer in Canada in 2000. Information on diagnostic approaches, treatment algorithms, follow-up and care at disease progression was obtained from various databases and was integrated into Statistics Canada's Population Health Model (POHEM) to estimate lifetime costs. The average lifetime cost (in Canadian dollars) of managing patients with colorectal cancer ranged from $20,319 per case for TNM stage I colon cancer to $39,182 per case for stage III rectal cancer. The total lifetime treatment cost for the cohort of patients in 2000 was estimated to be over $333 million for colon and $187 million for rectal cancer. Hospitalization represented 65% and 61% of the lifetime costs of colon and rectal cancer respectively. Disease costing models can be important policy-relevant tools to assist in resource allocation. Our results highlight the importance of performing preoperative tests and staging in an ambulatory care setting, where possible, to achieve optimal cost efficiencies. Similarly, terminal care might be delivered more efficiently in the home environment or in palliative care units.;Colorectal cancer, Costing model, Direct care costs, Lifetime cost, Micro-simulation,antineoplastic agent, article, Canada, cancer chemotherapy, cancer radiotherapy, cancer staging, colorectal cancer, cost benefit analysis, drug cost, health care cost, health care planning, health care policy, human, outpatient care, resource allocation, terminal care, treatment outcome, Canada, Colorectal Neoplasms, Combined Modality Therapy, Health Care Costs, Humans, Models, Economic, Neoplasm Recurrence, Local, Neoplasm Staging, Registries, Survival Analysis;;

Modeling the Cost-Effectiveness of Alternative Upper Age Limits for Breast Cancer Screening in England and Wales.;Rafia R1, Brennan A2, Madan J3, Collins K4, Reed MW5, Lawrence G6, Robinson T7, Greenberg D8, Wyld L9.;Value Health. 2016 Jun.19(4):404-12. doi: 10.1016/j.jval.2015.06.006. Epub 2015 Sep 11.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Currently in the United Kingdom, the National Health Service (NHS) Breast Screening Programme invites all women for triennial mammography between the ages of 47 and 73 years (the extension to 47-50 and 70-73 years is currently examined as part of a randomized controlled trial). The benefits and harms of screening in women 70 years and older, however, are less well documented. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine whether extending screening to women older than 70 years would represent a cost-effective use of NHS resources and to identify the upper age limit at which screening mammography should be extended in England and Wales. METHODS: A mathematical model that allows the impact of screening policies on cancer diagnosis and subsequent management to be assessed was built. The model has two parts: a natural history model of the progression of breast cancer up to discovery and a postdiagnosis model of treatment, recurrence, and survival. The natural history model was calibrated to available data and compared against published literature. The management of breast cancer at diagnosis was taken from registry data and valued using official UK tariffs. RESULTS: The model estimated that screening would lead to overdiagnosis in 6.2% of screen-detected women at the age of 72 years, increasing up to 37.9% at the age of 90 years. Under commonly quoted willingness-to-pay thresholds in the United Kingdom, our study suggests that an extension to screening up to the age of 78 years represents a cost-effective strategy. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides encouraging findings to support the extension of the screening program to older ages and suggests that further extension of the UK NHS Breast Screening Programme up to age 78 years beyond the current upper age limit of 73 years could be potentially cost-effective according to current NHS willingness-to-pay thresholds.

Modeling the cost-effectiveness of colorectal cancer screening: policy guidance based on patient preferences and compliance.;;Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2009 Jul.18(7):1971-8. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-09-0083. Epub 2009 Jun 30.;"Abstract BACKGROUND: Obtaining regular screening exams can significantly reduce colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality. Most CRC models to date have assumed ""ideal conditions"" such as 100% compliance, and the effects of CRC screening tests have been assessed only under these conditions. In this study, we assess cost-effectiveness incorporating real-world patient preferences and compliance. METHODOLOGY: We built an agent-based simulation model to assess the effect of compliance and patient preferences. Baseline values were derived from the 2003 and 2005 National Health Interview Survey, and effectiveness and cost parameters were obtained through literature review. Initial screening compliance was 45%, and compliance with follow-up diagnostic tests was 75%. RESULTS: The current level of screening reduces CRC mortality by 44.1% when compared with no screening. Increasing diagnostic follow-up compliance to 95% can lead to an additional 9.3% reduction in CRC mortality, whereas increasing initial screening compliance to 95% can result in an additional 50.4% reduction. These increases can be achieved at a cost of about $7,500 ($1,309-$32,864) per life year saved and $14,000 ($3,620-$35,855) per life year saved for diagnostic follow-up and initial screening tests, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing compliance with both initial screening test recommendation and diagnostic testing are cost-effective approaches. The most cost-effective approach under limited funding is to increase compliance with diagnostic testing for those already being screened. Targeted interventions, which are necessary to increase compliance, are generally cost-effective under the base case scenarios presented in this model, but additional studies are required to identify the most cost-effective approach.";Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.,Adenocarcinoma/economics,Adenocarcinoma/prevention & control*,Colonic Polyps/prevention & control,Colonoscopy/economics,Colorectal Neoplasms/economics,Colorectal Neoplasms/mortality,Colorectal Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Follow-Up Studies,Health Policy,Humans,Incidence,Male,Mass Screening/economics*,Mass Screening/methods,Occult Blood,Outcome Assessment (Health Care),Patient Compliance,Patient Satisfaction/economics,Policy Making,Risk Factors,Sigmoidoscopy/economics,United States/epidemiology,1 P30 CD000138-01/CD/ODCDC CDC HHS/United States;19567507;
Modelling future capacity needs and spending on colonoscopy in the English bowel cancer screening programme.;Nnoaham KE1, Lines C.;Gut. 2008 Sep.57(9):1238-45. doi: 10.1136/gut.2007.146050. Epub 2008 Apr 25.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Bowel cancer screening using faecal occult blood testing and colonoscopy is currently being rolled out across England. Guidelines recommend that people identified by colonoscopy as having intermediate- or high-risk bowel polyps be offered periodic surveillance colonoscopy because of their elevated risk of bowel cancer. We make projections of the likely year-on-year increase in volumes and spending on colonoscopy due to the screening and surveillance programmes. METHODS: We constructed a model based on current bowel cancer screening and surveillance guidelines using screening outcome measures taken from the second round of the English bowel screening pilot. This was then used to predict colonoscopy volumes and cost for a hypothetical population. RESULTS: For a hypothetical population of 500,000 people, with average deprivation and 66,956 subjects aged 60-74 years, the initial screening and surveillance round would be expected to detect 34 cancers at a cost of 394,157 pounds sterling. In the first 8 years, colonoscopy numbers will grow at a rate of 23 per year, most of which will be surveillance colonoscopies. Colonoscopy costs may grow by 11,808 pounds sterling yearly in the same period, representing a cost per eligible person of 2.86 pounds sterling initially, increasing by 0.13 pounds sterling every year. Sensitivity analyses suggest significant changes in these predictions if screening uptake changes by 20%.

Modelling the effect of breast cancer screening on related mortality using French data.;Uhry Z1, Hƒ?delin G, Colonna M, Asselain B, Arveux P, Exbrayat C, Guldenfelds C, Soler-Michel P, Moliniƒ?

Epub 2010 Dec 14.;Abstract INTRODUCTION: This study aimed at modelling the effect of organized breast cancer screening on mortality in France. It combined results from a Markov model for breast cancer progression, to predict number of cases by node status, and from relative survival analyses, to predict deaths. The method estimated the relative risk of mortality at 8 years, in women aged 50-69, between a population screened every two years and a reference population. METHODS: Analyses concerned cases diagnosed between 1990 and 1996, with a follow-up up to 2004 for the vital status. Markov models analysed data from 3 screening programs (300,000 mammographies) and took into account opportunistic screening among participants to avoid bias in parameter's estimates. We used survival data from cancers in the general population (n=918, 7 cancer registries) and from screened cancers (n=565, 3 cancer registries), after excluding a subgroup of screened cases with a particularly high survival. Sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Markov model main analysis lacked of fit in two out of three districts. Fit was improved in stratified analyses by age or district, though some lack of fit persisted in two districts. Assuming 10% or 20% overdiagnosed screened cancers, mortality reduction was estimated as 23% (95% CI: 4, 38%) and 19% (CI: -3, 35%) respectively. Results were highly sensitive to the exclusion in the screened cancers survival analysis. Conversely, RR estimates varied moderately according to the Markov model parameters used (stratified by age or district). CONCLUSION: The study aimed at estimating the effect of screening in a screened population compared to an unscreened control group. Such a control group does not exist in France, and we used a general population contaminated by opportunistic screening to provide a conservative estimate. Conservative choices were systematically adopted to avoid favourable estimates. A selection bias might however affect the estimates, though it should be moderate because extreme social classes are under-represented among participants. This modelling provided broad estimates for the effect of organized biennial screening in France in the early nineteen-nineties. Results will be strengthened with longer follow-up.

Modelling the future costs of breast screening.;Johnston K1.;Eur J Cancer. 2001 Sep.37(14):1752-8.;Abstract The aim of this paper was to estimate the future breast cancer and non-breast cancer costs associated with breast screening. The Nottingham prognostic index (NPI) was used to stratify patients into different prognostic groups and to predict the impact of breast screening on future costs. A Markov model was used to estimate breast cancer and non-breast costs for each prognostic group. Breast cancer costs were found to increase as the severity of prognosis increases. The opposite pattern was found for non-breast cancer costs. The total future costs (breast cancer and non-breast cancer costs) for each prognostic group was between pound10000 and pound11000. As a percentage of the costs of screening, the savings in future breast cancer costs were 20.9%. Inclusion of non-breast cancer costs cancelled out any potential savings in future breast cancer cost resulting from a better prognosis and resulted in an increase of 5.7% in future costs. Whether to include the latter type of cost remains a methodological issue of debate in economic evaluation.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis,Breast Neoplasms/economics*,Breast Neoplasms/therapy,Cost of Illness,England,Female,Health Care Costs/trends*,Humans,Markov Chains,Mass Screening/economics*,Middle Aged,Prognosis,Recurrence,Severity of Illness Index;11549428;
Modelling the impact of changes in sensitivity on the outcomes of the UK breast screening programme.;Taylor P1.;J Med Screen. 2010.17(1):31-6. doi: 10.1258/jms.2009.009048.;Abstract OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact on breast cancer mortality of improving the sensitivity of breast screening programmes. METHODS: A Markov model was populated with data obtained from published statistics describing the UK National Health Service Breast Screening Programme and the incidence and mortality of breast cancer in the UK. The model was used to study the impact of changes to the sensitivity of screening. The effects on cancer detection rates and breast cancers and total mortality was studied for a cohort of women followed from age 45 to age 89. RESULTS: Running the model from age 45 to 89, with sensitivity set at the baseline value of 75%, predicts the detection at screening of 44 cancers per thousand of population and the detection outside screening of 82 cancers per thousand of population. Running the model with values of sensitivity from 75% to 95% shows the proportion of cancers detected at screening increasing as screening improves, and deaths from breast cancer falling. The drop in breast cancer deaths is however modest. Increasing sensitivity from 75% to 85% reduces the number of breast cancer deaths from 28 to 27 per thousand. CONCLUSIONS: Likely achievable improvements in the sensitivity of screening do not have a marked effect on breast cancer mortality.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/mortality*,Early Detection of Cancer/statistics & numerical data*,Female,Humans,Middle Aged,Models, Theoretical,United Kingdom;20356943;
Modelling the impact of population-based cytologic screening on cervical cancer incidence and mortality in Hong Kong: An age-period-cohort approach;Woo P.P.S., Thach T.Q., Choy S.T.B., McGhee S.M., Leung G.M.;2005,British Journal of Cancer;Cervical cancer incidence and mortality statistics in Hong Kong during 1972-2001 were examined to estimate the potential number of cancer cases that can be averted and years of life saved after the launch of an organised, population-based cytologic screening recall programme in 2004 with projections to 2016. Incidence rates under the status quo of opportunistic screening were projected by an age-period-cohort model, using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. Modelled rates were translated into numbers of cancer cases and deaths using mid-year population figures and age-period-specific mortality to incidence ratios. We applied International Agency for Research on Cancer risk reduction estimates for different screening strategies to these base case figures to estimate the number of incident cancers potentially averted and years of life saved attributable to organised screening incremental to the current status quo. The estimated numbers of cases projected to be preventable by the maximum likelihood (Bayesian) approach from 2002 to 2016 were 4226 (4176), 3778 (3728) and 2334 (2287) with organised screening every 1, 3 and 5 years, compared to haphazard screening currently. Correspondingly, 33 000 (32 800), 29 500 (29 300) and 18 200 (17 900) years of life could potentially be saved. ? 2005 Cancer Research UK.;Age-period-cohort, Bayesian methods, Cervical cancer, Hong Kong, Maximum likelihood estimation, Screening;;
Modelling the likely effect of the increase of the upper age limit from 70 to 73 for breast screening in the UK National Programme.;Duffy SW1, Sasieni P, Olsen AH, Cafferty FH.;Stat Methods Med Res. 2010 Oct.19(5):547-55. doi: 10.1177/0962280209358140. Epub 2010 Feb 3.;Abstract The UK National Breast Screening Programme is planned to have the age range for invitation to screening expanded from 50-70 to 47-73. At the upper limit, this represents one additional screen taking place in the early 70s. We aimed to estimate the likely effect of this on breast cancer mortality and on overdiagnosis of breast cancer. We used estimates of breast cancer incidence and survival by detection mode (screening or symptomatic), screening lead time and mortality from competing causes to estimate the likely numbers of breast cancer deaths prevented per 1000 women screened, using both a stochastic continuous time model and a semi-deterministic discrete time model. In the continuous model, we estimated that per 1000 women screened 1.2 deaths would be prevented and in the discrete model 0.91 deaths. In the latter model, we also estimated that there would be around 6.8 years of life saved per 1000 women screened and an additional two diagnoses of breast cancer. These results suggest that the expansion of the upper age limit will be cost-effective. They remain to be confirmed by evaluation of the age extension. They provide prior estimates that may inform the evaluation of the age extension.;Age Factors*,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology,Breast Neoplasms/mortality,Female,Humans,Markov Chains,Mass Screening,Models, Statistical*,Stochastic Processes,United Kingdom/epidemiology;20130109;
Monitoring and evaluating the performance of the UK NHS Cervical Screening Programme: monitoring performance by using cytology outcomes adjusted for population characteristics.;;Cytopathology. 2004 Feb.15(1):5-11.;Abstract Current quality assurance measures used in the NHS cervical screening programme (NHSCSP) include a review of laboratories with percentages of moderate/severe and borderline/mild smear results outside the 10th-90th percentiles. The method is limited by the fact that many of these outlier smear percentages may reflect laboratories covering populations with low or high risk and/or short or long average screening intervals. This paper outlines a new approach to aid the detection of outlier laboratories, by using data collected at the primary care trust (PCT) or health authority (HA) level and making allowances for population characteristics and screening interval. The setting is the NHSCSP in England using annual data provided by HAs. Data from the screening year 2000-01 is used to illustrate the methodology, although the methods can also be applied to data at the PCT level (now being collected for 2002-03 onwards). Percentages of smear results have been analysed against a series of explanatory variables using logistic regression models. These explanatory variables include Townsend deprivation index, uptake-corrected ethnic minority composition, a measure of screening interval, area type and region. An expected percentage of borderline/mild and moderate/severe smears is estimated from the models and an observed : predicted ratio (OPRmod/sev and OPRbord/mild) calculated. Low values are suggestive of relative undercalling and high values overcalling, after allowance for population characteristics. Analysis of data for 2000-01 showed that the OPRmod/sev for the 99 HAs varied from 0.68 to 1.44. Laboratories with low percentages of moderate/severe smears, but associated with PCTs or HAs with OPRmod/sev values closer to unity may not need to be investigated as their observed rates are consistent with predicted rates based on population characteristics. The method could also be directly applied to laboratories if further information on the population covered by each laboratory were routinely collected.;Evaluation Studies,Female,Humans,Mass Screening,Models, Statistical,Quality Assurance, Health Care*,Regression Analysis,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Vaginal Smears/standards*;14748785;
Multilevel small-area estimation of colorectal cancer screening in the United States;Berkowitz Z., Zhang X., Richards T.B., Nadel M., Peipins L.A., Holt J.;2018,Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers and Prevention;Background: The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends routine screening for colorectal cancer for adults ages 50 to 75 years. We generated small-area estimates for being current with colorectal cancer screening to examine sociogeographic differences among states and counties. To our knowledge, nationwide county-level estimates for colorectal cancer screening are rarely presented. Methods: We used county data from the 2014 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS, n = 251,360 adults), linked it to the American Community Survey poverty data, and fitted multilevel logistic regression models. We post-stratified the data with the U.S. Census population data to run Monte Carlo simulations. We generated county-level screening prevalence estimates nationally and by race/ethnicity, mapped the estimates, and aggregated them into state and national estimates. We evaluated internal consistency of our modeled state-specific estimates with BRFSS direct state estimates using Spearman correlation coefficients. Results: Correlation coefficients were >0.95, indicating high internal consistency. We observed substantial variations in current colorectal cancer screening estimates among the states and counties within states. State mean estimates ranged from 58.92% in Wyoming to 75.03% in Massachusetts. County mean estimates ranged from 40.11% in Alaska to 79.76% in Florida. Larger county variations were observed in various race/ethnicity groups. Conclusions: State estimates mask county variations. However, both state and county estimates indicate that the country is far behind the 80% by 2018 target. Impact: County-modeled estimates help identify variation in colorectal cancer screening prevalence in the United States and guide education and enhanced screening efforts in areas of need, including areas without BRFSS direct-estimates. ? 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.;,adult, aged, Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Article, behavioral risk factor surveillance system, California, cancer epidemiology, cancer screening, colonoscopy, Colorado, colorectal cancer, Connecticut, controlled study, Delaware, District of Columbia, female, Florida, geographic distribution, Georgia (U.S.), Hawaii, human, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, major clinical study, male, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Monte Carlo method, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, priority journal, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming;;
Multistate transitional models for measuring adherence to breast cancer screening: A population-based longitudinal cohort study with over two million women.;Sutradhar R1,2,3, Gu S1, Paszat LF1,2,4.;J Med Screen. 2017 Jun.24(2):75-82. doi: 10.1177/0969141316654940. Epub 2016 Jul 19.;Abstract Objective Prior work on the disparities among women in breast cancer screening adherence has been methodologically limited. This longitudinal study determines and examines the factors associated with becoming adherent. Methods In a cohort of Canadian women aged 50-74, a three-state transitional model was used to examine adherence to screening for breast cancer. The proportion of time spent being non-adherent with screening was calculated for each woman during her observation window. Using age as the time scale, a relative rate multivariable regression was implemented under the three-state transitional model, to examine the association between covariates (all time-varying) and the rate of becoming adherent. Results The cohort consisted of 2,537,960 women with a median follow-up of 8.46 years. Nearly 31% of women were continually up-to-date with breast screening. Once a woman was non-adherent, the rate of becoming adherent was higher among longer term residents (relative rate¢??=¢??1.289, 95% confidence interval 1.275-1.302), those from wealthier neighbourhoods, and those who had an identifiable primary care provider who was female or had graduated in Canada. Conclusion Individual and physician-level characteristics play an important role in a woman's adherence to screening. This work improves the quality of evidence regarding disparities among women in adherence to breast cancer screening and provides a novel methodological foundation to investigate adherence for other types of screening, including cervix and colorectal cancer screening.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Aged,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Databases, Factual,Early Detection of Cancer/methods*,Female,Follow-Up Studies,Humans,Longitudinal Studies,Markov Chains,Mass Screening/methods,Mastectomy,Middle Aged,Multivariate Analysis,Ontario,Patient Compliance,Regression Analysis,Research Design,Retrospective Studies;27440758;
Natural history and screening model for high-risk human papillomavirus infection, neoplasia and cervical cancer in the Netherlands.;Berkhof J1, de Bruijne MC, Zielinski GD, Meijer CJ.;Int J Cancer. 2005 Jun 10.115(2):268-75.;Abstract A simulation model is presented that assumes that persistent infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) is a necessary cause of cervical cancer. For the estimation of the model parameters, data of recent Dutch follow-up studies were reanalyzed. The predicted incidences of cervical cancer, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN1, CIN2 and CIN3) and abnormal cytology were validated with nationwide figures and population-based screening results. The model predicted a lifetime risk for cervical cancer of 2.9% with a peak at age 48 years. The predicted lifetime risk dropped to 0.4% when attending cervical screening. For women who were not hrHPV infected at 30 years, the lifetime risk was 1.6%. Sensitivity analyses were performed to check natural history assumptions that were only weakly identified from available data sets. The incidence of CIN3 observed with screening appeared a useful clinical end point as the predicted incidence was robust against changes in the sensitivity of cervical cytology and the duration to CIN3. The model can be used to study the health-economic benefits that can be achieved in nationwide screening when including an hrHPV test.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adolescent,Adult,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/epidemiology,Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/virology*,Computer Simulation*,Female,Follow-Up Studies,Genetics, Population,Humans,Incidence,Mass Screening,Middle Aged,Netherlands/epidemiology,Papillomaviridae/isolation & purification*,Papillomavirus Infections/epidemiology,Papillomavirus Infections/virology*,Prognosis,Risk Factors,Survival Rate,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/virology*;15688404;
Optimal use of colonoscopy and fecal immunochemical test for population-based colorectal cancer screening: a cost-effectiveness analysis using Japanese data.;;Jpn J Clin Oncol. 2016 Feb.46(2):116-25. doi: 10.1093/jjco/hyv186. Epub 2015 Dec 18.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: There have been few cost-effectiveness analyses of population-based colorectal cancer screening in Japan, and there is no consensus on the optimal use of total colonoscopy and the fecal immunochemical test for colorectal cancer screening with regard to cost-effectiveness and total colonoscopy workload. The present study aimed to examine the cost-effectiveness of colorectal cancer screening using Japanese data to identify the optimal use of total colonoscopy and fecal immunochemical test. METHODS: We developed a Markov model to assess the cost-effectiveness of colorectal cancer screening offered to an average-risk population aged 40 years or over. The cost, quality-adjusted life-years and number of total colonoscopy procedures required were evaluated for three screening strategies: (i) a fecal immunochemical test-based strategy. (ii) a total colonoscopy-based strategy. (iii) a strategy of adding population-wide total colonoscopy at 50 years to a fecal immunochemical test-based strategy. RESULTS: All three strategies dominated no screening. Among the three, Strategy 1 was dominated by Strategy 3, and the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-years gained for Strategy 2 against Strategies 1 and 3 were JPY 293 616 and JPY 781 342, respectively. Within the Japanese threshold (JPY 5-6 million per QALY gained), Strategy 2 was the most cost-effective, followed by Strategy 3. however, Strategy 2 required more than double the number of total colonoscopy procedures than the other strategies. CONCLUSIONS: The total colonoscopy-based strategy could be the most cost-effective for population-based colorectal cancer screening in Japan. However, it requires more total colonoscopy procedures than the other strategies. Depending on total colonoscopy capacity, the strategy of adding total colonoscopy for individuals at a specified age to a fecal immunochemical test-based screening may be an optimal solution. ¯õ?

Optimizing resource allocation for breast cancer prevention and care among Hong Kong Chinese women.;;Cancer. 2012 Sep 15.118(18):4394-403. doi: 10.1002/cncr.27448. Epub 2012 Feb 22.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Recommendations about funding of interventions through the full spectrum of the disease often have been made in isolation. The authors of this report optimized budgetary allocations by comparing cost-effectiveness data for different preventive and management strategies throughout the disease course for breast cancer in Hong Kong (HK) Chinese women. METHODS: Nesting a state-transition Markov model within a generalized cost-effectiveness analytic framework, costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were compared to estimate average cost-effectiveness ratios for the following interventions at the population level: biennial mass mammography (ages 40-69 years or ages 40-79 years), reduced waiting time for postoperative radiotherapy (by 15% or by 25%), adjuvant endocrine therapy (either upfront aromatase inhibitor [AI] therapy or sequentially with tamoxifen followed by AI) in postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive disease, targeted immunotherapy in those with tumors that over express human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, and enhanced palliative services (either at home or as an inpatient). Usual care for eligible patients in the public sector was the comparator. RESULTS: In descending order, the optimal allocation of additional resources for breast cancer would be the following: a 25% reduction in waiting time for postoperative radiotherapy (in US dollars: $5000 per QALY). enhanced, home-based palliative care ($7105 per QALY). adjuvant, sequential endocrine therapy ($17,963 per QALY). targeted immunotherapy ($62,092 per QALY). and mass mammography screening of women ages 40 to 69 years ($72,576 per QALY). CONCLUSIONS: Given the lower disease risk and different age profiles of patients in HK Chinese, among other newly emergent and emerging economies with similar transitioning epidemiologic profiles, the current findings provided direct evidence to support policy decisions that may be dissimilar to current Western practice.

Overtreatment and Cost-Effectiveness of the See-and-Treat Strategy for Managing Cervical Precancer.;;Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2016 May.25(5):807-14. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-15-1044. Epub 2016 Feb 29.;Abstract BACKGROUND: See-and-treat using loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) has been recommended as an alternative in managing high-grade cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions, but existing literature lacks evidence of the strategy's cost-effectiveness. We evaluated the overtreatment and cost-effectiveness of the see-and-treat strategy compared with usual care. METHODS: We modeled a hypothetical cohort of 40-year-old females who had not been screened for cervical cancer and followed them through their lifetimes using a Markov model. From a U.S. health-system perspective, the analysis was conducted in 2012 dollars and measured effectiveness in quality-adjusted life-years (QALY). We estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) using a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY. The robustness of the see-and-treat strategy's cost-effectiveness and its overtreatment rates were further examined in various sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: In the base-case, the see-and-treat strategy yielded an ICER of $70,774/QALY compared with usual care. For most scenarios in the deterministic sensitivity analysis, this strategy had ICERs larger than $50,000/QALY, and its cost-effectiveness was sensitive to the disutility of LEEP treatment and biopsy-directed treatment adherence under usual care. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that the see-and-treat strategy had a 50.1% chance to be cost-effective. It had an average overtreatment rate of 7.1% and a 78.8% chance to have its overtreatment rate lower than the 10% threshold. CONCLUSION: The see-and-treat strategy induced an acceptable overtreatment rate. Its cost-effectiveness, compared with usual care, was indiscriminating at the chosen willingness-to-pay threshold but much improved when the threshold increased. IMPACT: The see-and-treat strategy was reasonable for particular settings, that is, those with low treatment adherence.

Performance and Cost-Effectiveness of Computed Tomography Lung Cancer Screening Scenarios in a Population-Based Setting: A Microsimulation Modeling Analysis in Ontario, Canada.;Ten Haaf K1, Tammemƒýgi MC2, Bondy SJ3,4, van der Aalst CM1, Gu S5, McGregor SE6, Nicholas G7, de Koning HJ1, Paszat LF3,5.;PLoS Med. 2017 Feb 7.14(2):e1002225. doi: 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002225. eCollection 2017 Feb.;Abstract BACKGROUND: The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) results indicate that computed tomography (CT) lung cancer screening for current and former smokers with three annual screens can be cost-effective in a trial setting. However, the cost-effectiveness in a population-based setting with >3 screening rounds is uncertain. Therefore, the objective of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of lung cancer screening in a population-based setting in Ontario, Canada, and evaluate the effects of screening eligibility criteria. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This study used microsimulation modeling informed by various data sources, including the Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP), Ontario Cancer Registry, smoking behavior surveys, and the NLST. Persons, born between 1940 and 1969, were examined from a third-party health care payer perspective across a lifetime horizon. Starting in 2015, 576 CT screening scenarios were examined, varying by age to start and end screening, smoking eligibility criteria, and screening interval. Among the examined outcome measures were lung cancer deaths averted, life-years gained, percentage ever screened, costs (in 2015 Canadian dollars), and overdiagnosis. The results of the base-case analysis indicated that annual screening was more cost-effective than biennial screening. Scenarios with eligibility criteria that required as few as 20 pack-years were dominated by scenarios that required higher numbers of accumulated pack-years. In general, scenarios that applied stringent smoking eligibility criteria (i.e., requiring higher levels of accumulated smoking exposure) were more cost-effective than scenarios with less stringent smoking eligibility criteria, with modest differences in life-years gained. Annual screening between ages 55-75 for persons who smoked ¢??40 pack-years and who currently smoke or quit ¢?ý10 y ago yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $41,136 Canadian dollars ($33,825 in May 1, 2015, United States dollars) per life-year gained (compared to annual screening between ages 60-75 for persons who smoked ¢??40 pack-years and who currently smoke or quit ¢?ý10 y ago), which was considered optimal at a cost-effectiveness threshold of $50,000 Canadian dollars ($41,114 May 1, 2015, US dollars). If 50% lower or higher attributable costs were assumed, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of this scenario was estimated to be $38,240 ($31,444 May 1, 2015, US dollars) or $48,525 ($39,901 May 1, 2015, US dollars), respectively. If 50% lower or higher costs for CT examinations were assumed, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of this scenario was estimated to be $28,630 ($23,542 May 1, 2015, US dollars) or $73,507 ($60,443 May 1, 2015, US dollars), respectively. This scenario would screen 9.56% (499,261 individuals) of the total population (ever- and never-smokers) at least once, which would require 4,788,523 CT examinations, and reduce lung cancer mortality in the total population by 9.05% (preventing 13,108 lung cancer deaths), while 12.53% of screen-detected cancers would be overdiagnosed (4,282 overdiagnosed cases). Sensitivity analyses indicated that the overall results were most sensitive to variations in CT examination costs.

Performance of mammography and Papanicolau among rural women in Mexico [Practica de mastografias y pruebas de papanicolaou entre mujeres de areas rurales de Mexico];Sosa-Rubi S.G., Walker D., Servan E.;2009,Salud Publica de Mexico;Objective. To analyze the frequency of reporting a recently conducted mammogram and/or pap smear and follow-up of abnormal findings among rural poor women in Mexico. Methods. We performed a cross-sectional analysis using data collected in the ENCEL 2007-Oportunidades survey carried out between July - November, 2007. We used multilevel logistic regression to model the use of mammography and pap smears. Results. We found a low frequency of reported recent mammogram among the rural poor from 30-39 years old (12%) and 40-49 years old (16%) and a low frequency of reported medical follow-up of abnormal findings (60%), particularly among women at higher risk because of age or abnormal findings. These findings were associated with a lack of availability of medical resources and being of indigenous origin. Conclusion. It is fundamental to strengthen both access to and follow-up of mammography and papsmears, particularly among high-risk rural women in order to reduce the level of mortality associated with breast and cervical-uterine cancer.;Breast cancer, Cervical-uterine cancer, Mammography, Mexico, Pap, Rural areas;;

Population-based mammography screening below age 50: balancing radiation-induced vs prevented breast cancer deaths.;de Gelder R1, Draisma G, Heijnsdijk EA, de Koning HJ.;Br J Cancer. 2011 Mar 29.104(7):1214-20. doi: 10.1038/bjc.2011.67. Epub 2011 Mar 1.;Abstract INTRODUCTION: Exposure to ionizing radiation at mammography screening may cause breast cancer. Because the radiation risk increases with lower exposure age, advancing the lower age limit may affect the balance between screening benefits and risks. The present study explores the benefit-risk ratio of screening before age 50. METHODS: The benefits of biennial mammography screening, starting at various ages between 40 and 50, and continuing up to age 74 were examined using micro-simulation. In contrast with previous studies that commonly used excess relative risk models, we assessed the radiation risks using the latest BEIR-VII excess absolute rate exposure-risk model. RESULTS: The estimated radiation risk is lower than previously assessed. At a mean glandular dose of 1.3¢??mGy per view that was recently measured in the Netherlands, biennial mammography screening between age 50 and 74 was predicted to induce 1.6 breast cancer deaths per 100,000 women aged 0-100 (range 1.3-6.3 extra deaths at a glandular dose of 1-5¢??mGy per view), against 1121 avoided deaths in this population. Advancing the lower age limit for screening to include women aged 40-74 was predicted to induce 3.7 breast cancer deaths per 100,000 women aged 0-100 (range 2.9-14.4) at biennial screening, but would also prevent 1302 deaths. CONCLUSION: The benefits of mammography screening between age 40 and 74 were predicted to outweigh the radiation risks.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Age Factors,Aged,Breast Neoplasms/etiology*,Breast Neoplasms/mortality,Female,Humans,Mammography/adverse effects*,Middle Aged,Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/etiology*,Radiation Dosage;21364575;
Potential cost-effectiveness of one-time screening for lung cancer (LC) in a high risk cohort.;Marshall D1, Simpson KN, Earle CC, Chu C.;Lung Cancer. 2001 Jun.32(3):227-36.;Abstract The development of low-dose helical computed-tomography (CT) scanning to detect nodules as small as a few mm has sparked renewed interest in lung cancer (LC) screening. The objective of this study was to assess the potential health effects and cost-effectiveness of a one-time low-dose helical CT scan to screen for LC. We created a decision analysis model using baseline results from the Early Lung Cancer Action Project (ELCAP). Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) registry public-use database. screening program costs estimated from 1999 Medicare reimbursement rates. and annual costs of managing cancer and non-cancer patients from Riley et al. (1995) [Med Care 1995.33(8):828-841] and Taplin et al. (1995) [J Natl Cancer Inst 1995.87(6):417-26]. The main outcome measures included years of life, cost estimates of baseline diagnostic screening and follow up, and cost-effectiveness of screening. We found that in a very high-risk cohort (LC prevalence of 2.7%) of patients between 60 and 74 years of age, a one-time screen appears to be cost-effective at $5940 per life year saved. In a lower risk general population of smokers (LC prevalence of 0.7%), a one-time screen appears to be cost-effective at $23100 per life year. Even when a lead-time bias of 1 year is incorporated into the model for a low risk population, the cost-effectiveness is estimated at $58183 per life year. Based on the assumptions embedded in this model, one-time screening of elderly high-risk patients for LC appears to be cost-effective.;Evaluation Studies,Aged,Cohort Studies,Computer Simulation,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Decision Trees,Humans,Life Expectancy,Lung Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Mass Screening/economics*,Middle Aged,Models, Econometric*,Risk Factors,Survival Analysis,Tomography, X-Ray Computed/economics*;11390004;
Potential impact of population-based colorectal cancer screening in Canada.;Flanagan WM1, Le Petit C, Berthelot JM, White KJ, Coombs BA, Jones-McLean E.;Chronic Dis Can. 2003 Fall.24(4):81-8.;Abstract Randomized controlled trials (RCT) have shown the efficacy of screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) using the faecal occult blood test (FOBT) with follow-up by colonoscopy. We evaluated the potential impact of population-based screening by FOBT followed by colonoscopy in Canada: mortality reduction, cost-effectiveness, and resource requirements. The microsimulation model POHEM was adapted to simulate CRC screening using Canadian data and RCT results about test sensitivity and specificity, participation, incidence, staging, progression, mortality and direct health care costs. In Canada, biennial screening of 67% of individuals aged 50-74 in the year 2000 resulted in an estimated 10-year CRC mortality reduction of 16.7%. The life expectancy of the cohort increased by 15 days on average and the demand for colonoscopy rose by 15% in the first year. The estimated cost of screening was $112 million per year or $11,907 per life-year gained (discounted at 5%). Potential effectiveness would depend on reaching target participation rates and finding resources to meet the demand for FOBT and colonoscopy.

Predicting impacts of mass-screening policy changes on breast cancer mortality.;Seppƒýnen J1, Heinƒývaara S, Hakulinen T.;Stat Med. 2008 Nov 10.27(25):5235-51. doi: 10.1002/sim.3345.;Abstract The aim of this study is to present a methodology for taking into account the mass-screening invitation data in breast cancer mortality predictions, particularly in assessing impacts of screening policy changes on the short-term predictions. The methodology is applied to a database that includes observed year- and age-specific screening invitation schemes in Finnish municipalities from the time period 1987-2001. The target year for predictions is 2012. To predict mortality, breast cancer incidence and patients' survival from breast cancer are modelled with the screening data included. The knowledge of breast cancer survival together with the other cause survival is then used to calculate the number of breast cancer deaths caused by observed (1987-2001) and predicted (2002-2012) incident cases in Finland. Survival from breast cancer was estimated with a parametric mixture model where the patient population is assumed to be a combination of cured and uncured patients. This approach provides a way of modelling the hazard of fatal cases and the proportion of cured cases simultaneously. In other cause survival, the patients' hazard was allowed to differ from that of the general population. Breast cancer mortality predictions are presented according to three alternative future scenarios of screening policy. The results show no major differences between predictions yielded by alternative scenarios: Any policy change would have at the most a 3.0 per cent impact on breast cancer mortality in the near future.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Breast Neoplasms/mortality*,Finland/epidemiology,Forecasting,Humans,Mass Screening*/statistics & numerical data,Models, Statistical,Policy Making*;18613224;
Predicting the change in breast cancer deaths in Spain by 2019: a Bayesian approach.;Clƒðries R1, Martƒ?nez JM, Moreno V, Yasui Y, Ribes J, Borrƒÿs JM.;Epidemiology. 2013 May.24(3):454-60. doi: 10.1097/EDE.0b013e31828b0866.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Breast cancer mortality rates have been decreasing in Spain since 1992. Recent changes in demography, breast cancer therapy, and early detection of breast cancer may change this trend. METHODS: Using breast cancer mortality data from years 1990 to 2009, we sought to predict the changes in the burden of breast cancer mortality during the years 2005-2019 through a Bayesian age-period-cohort model. The net change in the number of breast cancer deaths between the periods of 2015-2019 and 2005-2009 was separated into changes in population demographics and changes in the risk of death from breast cancer. RESULTS: During the period 1990-2009, breast cancer mortality rates decreased (age-standardized rates per 100,000 women-years 50.6 in 1990-1994 vs. 41.1 in 2005-2009), whereas the number of breast cancer deaths increased (28,149 in 1990-1994. 29,926 in 2005-2009). There was a decrease in the number of cases among women 45-64 years of age (10,942 in 1990-1994. 8,647 in 2005-2009). Changes in population demographics contribute to a total increase of 12.5-12.8% comparing periods 2005-2009 versus 2015-2019, whereas changes in the risk of death from breast cancer contribute to a reduction of 12.9-13.7%. We predict a net decline of 0.1-1.2% in the absolute number of breast cancer deaths comparing these time periods. CONCLUSIONS: The decrease in the risk of death from breast cancer may exceed the projected increase in deaths from growing population size and aging in Spain. These changes may also explain the decrease in the absolute number of breast cancer deaths in Spain since 2005.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Bayes Theorem,Breast Neoplasms/mortality*,Cohort Studies,Female,Forecasting,Humans,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical,Spain/epidemiology;23493031;

Prevention of cervical cancer with screening programme in Branicevo District and cost-effectiveness analysis adjusted to the territory of the Republic of Serbia.;;J BUON. 2009 Jan-Mar.14(1):93-6.;Abstract PURPOSE: To establish the so-called positive screening instead of the current opportunistic screening for cervical cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The program of positive screening covered all female persons aged 30-49 years living in the Branicevo District. All women were sent an invitation to participate in the screening and those who responded had Papanicolaou smear test done on the results of which further diagnostic procedures would be determined. RESULTS: The invitation to examination was responded by 11,200 (48.70%) out of 23,000 women invited. The costs of organized screening per capita amounted to Republic of Serbia dinar (RSD) 380.00 (EUR 4.75). 954 patients in total underwent colposcopy and conization, resulting in RSD total costs of 11,926,373.70 (149,079.00 EUR). Assuming the same incidence rate among the population that did not respond to the invitation, the number of women that would have such an intervention would be increased by 893. CONCLUSION: One-year screening programme is more effective than 3-year programme (180 lives saved compared to 113), but more expensive.

Primary screening for human papillomavirus compared with cytology screening for cervical cancer in European settings: cost effectiveness analysis based on a Dutch microsimulation model.;de Kok IM1, van Rosmalen J, Dillner J, Arbyn M, Sasieni P, Iftner T, van Ballegooijen M.;BMJ. 2012 Mar 5.344:e670. doi: 10.1136/bmj.e670.;Abstract OBJECTIVES: To investigate, using a Dutch model, whether and under what variables framed for other European countries screening for human papillomavirus (HPV) is preferred over cytology screening for cervical cancer, and to calculate the preferred number of examinations over a woman's lifetime. DESIGN: Cost effectiveness analysis based on a Dutch simulation model. Base case analyses investigated the cost effectiveness of more than 1500 different screening policies using the microsimulation model. Subsequently, the policies were compared for five different scenarios that represent different possible scenarios (risk of cervical cancer, previous screening, quality associated test characteristics, costs of testing, and prevalence of HPV). SETTING: Various European countries. POPULATION: Unvaccinated women born between 1939 and 1992. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Optimal screening strategy in terms of incremental cost effectiveness ratios (costs per quality adjusted life years gained) compared with different cost effectiveness thresholds, for two levels of sensitivity and costs of the HPV test. RESULTS: Primary HPV screening was the preferred primary test over the age of 30 in many considered scenarios. Primary cytology screening was preferred only in scenarios with low costs of cytology and in scenarios with a high prevalence of HPV in combination with high costs of HPV testing. CONCLUSIONS: Most European countries should consider switching from primary cytology to HPV screening for cervical cancer. HPV screening must, however, only be implemented in situations where screening is well controlled.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Alphapapillomavirus/isolation & purification*,Computer Simulation*,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Europe,Female,Humans,Models, Economic*,Netherlands,Papillomavirus Infections/diagnosis*,Papillomavirus Infections/economics,Sensitivity and Specificity,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/economics,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/virology,Vaginal Smears/economics*,C8162/A10406/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom;22391612;

Probabilistic cost-effectiveness modeling of different breast cancer screening policies in Slovenia.;Rojnik K1, Naversnik K, Mateovi„?-Rojnik T, Primiczakelj M.;Value Health. 2008 Mar-Apr.11(2):139-48. doi: 10.1111/j.1524-4733.2007.00223.x.;Abstract OBJECTIVES: To determine the most cost-effective screening policy for population-based mammography breast cancer screening in Slovenia using probabilistic sensitivity analysis. METHODS: A time-dependent Markov model for breast cancer was constructed. General principles of cost-effectiveness analysis with multiple strategies were used to compare the costs and effects of 36 different screening policies. Using probability distributions for model parameters, the true effect of uncertainty across model input parameters on expected costs and effects was explored. The results from probabilistic simulation analysis are presented in a form of cost-effectiveness acceptability curves with cost-effectiveness acceptability frontier. RESULTS: With the presented analysis, it was shown that a 1-year screening interval in population breast cancer screening would produce less benefits at higher costs than less intensive screening and that a 2-year interval would be cost-effective only at high values of society's willingness to pay per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Therefore, the optimal screening policy should be chosen among 3-year-interval policies. CONCLUSIONS: Based on commonly quoted thresholds of society's willingness to pay per QALY of $50,000, the optimal approach in the Slovenian population would be screening women aged from 40 to 80 years every 3 years.;Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/economics,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Early Diagnosis,Female,Health Care Costs,Health Policy/economics*,Humans,Mammography/economics*,Mass Screening/economics*,Mass Screening/methods,Models, Statistical*,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,Slovenia;18380626;
Program-specific cost-effectiveness analysis: breast cancer screening policies for a safety-net program.;Melnikow J1, Tancredi DJ, Yang Z, Ritley D, Jiang Y, Slee C, Popova S, Rylett P, Knutson K, Smalley S.;Value Health. 2013 Sep-Oct.16(6):932-41. doi: 10.1016/j.jval.2013.06.013.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Every Woman Counts (EWC), a California breast cancer screening program, faced challenging budget cutbacks and policy choices. METHODS: A microsimulation model evaluated costs, outcomes, and cost-effectiveness of EWC program mammography policy options on coverage for digital mammography (which has a higher cost than film mammography but recent legislation allowed reimbursement at the lower film rate). screening eligibility age. and screening frequency. Model inputs were based on analyses of program claims data linked to California Cancer Registry data, Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data, and the Medi-Cal literature. Outcomes included number of procedures, cancers, cancer deaths, costs, and incremental cost per life-year. RESULTS: Projected model outcomes matched program data closely. With restrictions on the number of clients screened, strategies starting screening at age 40 years were dominated (not cost-effective). This finding was highly robust in sensitivity analyses. Compared with no screening, biennial film mammography for women aged 50 to 64 years was projected to reduce 15-year breast cancer mortality by nearly 7.8% at $18,999 per additional life-year, annual film mammography was $106,428 per additional life-year, and digital mammography $180,333 per additional life-year. This more effective, more expensive strategy was projected to reduce breast cancer mortality by 8.6%. Under equal mammography reimbursement, biennial digital mammography beginning at age 50 years was projected to decrease 15-year breast cancer mortality by 8.6% at an incremental cost per additional life-year of $17,050. CONCLUSIONS: For the EWC program, biennial screening mammography starting at age 50 years was the most cost-effective strategy. The impact of digital mammography on life expectancy was small. Program-specific cost-effectiveness analysis can be completed in a policy-relevant time frame to assist policymakers faced with difficult program choices.

Prostate cancer, the PSA test and academic detailing in Australian general practice: an economic evaluation.;Stone CA1, May FW, Pinnock CB, Elwood M, Rowett DS.;Aust N Z J Public Health. 2005 Aug.29(4):349-57.;Abstract OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether introduction of a national education program for GPs to improve decision making relating to the use of prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing for screening represents 'value-for-money' from the perspective of the Australian Government. METHODS: The annual equivalent costs and consequences of a proposed national program in steady state operation are estimated for Australia using 1996 as the reference year. Because of the controversy about the efficacy of screening using PSA testing, two scenarios are modelled. Uncertainty in the model is examined using Monte Carlo simulation methods. RESULTS: In scenario  our model predicts that the national program would cost dollars 12.5 million (gross) or dollars 6.6 million (net), would reduce the burden of disease by 4.7% of total DALYs due to prostate cancer in those aged 70 and over, with no loss of life and an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of dollars 16,000/DALY (gross) and dollars 8,500/DALY (net). In scenario two, the proposed program would cost dollars 12.5 million (gross) or dollars 7.1 million (net), would reduce the burden of disease by 3.1% of total, increase by 44 the prostate cancer deaths at an ICER of dollars 24,000/DALY (gross) and dollars 14,000/DALY (net). CONCLUSIONS: These findings, with an overall health benefit at moderate cost and acceptable ICER, support the case for consideration of a national education program on the assumption that prostate cancer screening over age 70 does not reduce mortality. A larger Australian study currently being conducted should provide stronger evidence on the value of implementing a full national program.;Evaluation Studies,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Australia/epidemiology,Cost-Benefit Analysis/methods,Decision Support Techniques,Family Practice/economics,Family Practice/education*,Humans,Male,Mass Screening/economics*,Models, Biological,Models, Econometric*,Monte Carlo Method,National Health Programs/economics*,Prostate-Specific Antigen*,Prostatic Neoplasms/diagnosis,Prostatic Neoplasms/economics,Prostatic Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,Training Support/economics*,Uncertainty,Prostate-Specific Antigen;16222933;

Reappraisal of the options for colorectal cancer screening in England.;Whyte S1, Chilcott J, Halloran S.;Colorectal Dis. 2012 Sep.14(9):e547-61. doi: 10.1111/j.1463-1318.2012.03014.x.;Abstract AIM: The aim was to use newly available data to estimate the cost effectiveness and endoscopy requirements of screening options for colorectal cancer (CRC) to inform screening policy in England. METHODS: A state transition model simulated the life experience of a cohort of individuals in the general population of England with normal colon/rectal epithelium through to the development of adenomas and CRC and subsequent death. CRC natural history model parameters and screening test characteristics were estimated simultaneously by a process of model calibration. This process was fitted to observed data on CRC incidence in the absence of screening, data from existing screening programmes, and data from the UK flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS) screening trial. The costs, effects and resource impact were evaluated for a range of screening options involving the guaiac or immunochemical faecal occult blood test (gFOBT/iFOBT) and FS. RESULTS: The model suggests that screening strategies involving FS or iFOBT may produce additional benefits compared with the current policy of biennial gFOBT for 60-74-year-olds. The age at which a single FS screen results in the greatest quality-adjusted life year gain was 55, with similar gains for ages between 52 and 58. Strategies which combined FS and iFOBT showed further benefits and improved economic outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Strategies which combine different screening modalities may provide greater clinical and economic benefits. The collection of comprehensive screening data using a uniform format will enable comparative analysis across screening programmes in different countries, will improve our understanding of the disease and will allow identification of optimal screening modalities. ‚? 2012 The Authors.

Reasons women do not attend screening for cervical cancer: A population-based study in Sweden;Eaker S., Adami H.-O., Sparen P.;2001,Preventive Medicine;Background. With an improved compliance with screening a larger reduction of cervical cancer incidence would be within reach. We aimed at investigating why certain women do not attend Pap smear screening and at validating the reliability of self-reported screening. Methods. In 1998 in the county of Uppsala, Sweden, information was collected through telephone interviews with 430 nonattendees and 514 attendees to Pap smear screening, who were all sampled from a population-based database. The women's recall of attendance was validated against the database. The main outcome measures used were odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results. Non-attendance was positively associated with nonuse of oral contraceptives (OR = 3.56, 95% CI 2.18-5.83), seeing different gynecologists (OR = 1.90, 95% CI 1.34-2.70), and seeing a physician very often (OR = 3.12, 95% CI 1.45-6.70) or not at all (OR = 1.78, 95% CI 1.09-2.90). Frequent condom use (OR = 1.88, 95% CI 1.02-3.47), living in rural/semirural areas (OR = 1.55, 95% CI 1.07-2.21), and not knowing the recommended screening interval (OR = 2.16, 95% CI 1.20-3.89) were all associated with nonattendance, whereas socioeconomic status was not, when tested in a multivariate model. Among the nonattendees, 57% underestimated the time lapse since last smear. Conclusions. Seeing a gynecologist on a regular basis and information guiding women to have a Pap smear on their own initiative are important factors for recurrent screening. Therefore, information should be given to all women about the purpose and benefits of Pap smear testing. Self-reports on screening should be treated with caution. ? 2001 American Health Foundation and Academic Press.;Cervical cancer, Nonattendance, Pap smear screening;;

Rescreening of persons with a negative colonoscopy result: results from a microsimulation model.;;Ann Intern Med. 2012 Nov 6.157(9):611-20. doi: 10.7326/0003-4819-157-9-201211060-00005.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Persons with a negative result on screening colonoscopy are recommended to repeat the procedure in 10 years. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness and costs of colonoscopy versus other rescreening strategies after an initial negative colonoscopy result. DESIGN: Microsimulation model. DATA SOURCES: Literature and data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program. TARGET POPULATION: Persons aged 50 years who had no adenomas or cancer detected on screening colonoscopy. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTION: No further screening or rescreening starting at age 60 years with colonoscopy every 10 years, annual highly sensitive guaiac fecal occult blood testing (HSFOBT), annual fecal immunochemical testing (FIT), or computed tomographic colonography (CTC) every 5 years. OUTCOME MEASURES: Lifetime cases of colorectal cancer, life expectancy, and lifetime costs per 1000 persons, assuming either perfect or imperfect adherence. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Rescreening with any method substantially reduced the risk for colorectal cancer compared with no further screening (range, 7.7 to 12.6 lifetime cases per 1000 persons [perfect adherence] and 17.7 to 20.9 lifetime cases per 1000 persons [imperfect adherence] vs. 31.3 lifetime cases per 1000 persons with no further screening). In both adherence scenarios, the differences in life-years across rescreening strategies were small (range, 30 893 to 30 902 life-years per 1000 persons [perfect adherence] vs. 30 865 to 30 869 life-years per 1000 persons [imperfect adherence]). Rescreening with HSFOBT, FIT, or CTC had fewer complications and was less costly than continuing colonoscopy. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Results were sensitive to test-specific adherence rates. LIMITATION: Data on adherence to rescreening were limited. CONCLUSION: Compared with the currently recommended strategy of continuing colonoscopy every 10 years after an initial negative examination, rescreening at age 60 years with annual HSFOBT, annual FIT, or CTC every 5 years provides approximately the same benefit in life-years with fewer complications at a lower cost. Therefore, it is reasonable to use other methods to rescreen persons with negative colonoscopy results.

Risk of cervical cancer associated with extending the interval between cervical-cancer screenings.;Sawaya GF1, McConnell KJ, Kulasingam SL, Lawson HW, Kerlikowske K, Melnikow J, Lee NC, Gildengorin G, Myers ER, Washington AE.;N Engl J Med. 2003 Oct 16.349(16):1501-9.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Although contemporary guidelines suggest that the intervals between Papanicolaou tests can be extended to three years among low-risk women with previous negative tests, the excess risk of cervical cancer associated with less frequent than annual screening is uncertain. METHODS: We determined the prevalence of biopsy-proven cervical neoplasia among 938,576 women younger than 65 years of age, stratified according to the number of previous consecutive negative Papanicolaou tests. Using a Markov model that estimates the rate at which dysplasia will progress to cancer, we estimated the risk of cancer within three years after one or more negative Papanicolaou tests, as well as the number of additional Papanicolaou tests and colposcopic examinations that would be required to avert one case of cancer given a particular interval between screenings. RESULTS: Among 31,728 women 30 to 64 years of age who had had three or more consecutive negative tests, the prevalence of biopsy-proven cervical intraepithelial neoplasia of grade 2 was 0.028 percent and the prevalence of grade 3 neoplasia was 0.019 percent. none of the women had invasive cervical cancer. According to our model, the estimated risk of cancer with annual Papanicolaou tests for three years was 2 in 100,000 among women 30 to 44 years of age, 1 in 100,000 among women 45 to 59 years of age, and 1 in 100,000 among women 60 to 64 years of age. these risks would be 5 in 100,000, 2 in 100,000, and 1 in 100,000, respectively, if screening were performed once three years after the last negative test. To avert one additional case of cancer by screening 100,000 women annually for three years rather than once three years after the last negative test, an average of 69,665 additional Papanicolaou tests and 3861 colposcopic examinations would be needed in women 30 to 44 years of age and an average of 209,324 additional Papanicolaou tests and 11,502 colposcopic examinations in women 45 to 59 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: As compared with annual screening for three years, screening performed once three years after the last negative test in women 30 to 64 years of age who have had three or more consecutive negative Papanicolaou tests is associated with an average excess risk of cervical cancer of approximately 3 in 100,000.

Screening 3 years after negative test, rather than annually, would result in three additional cases of cervical cancer per 100,000 women screened,; Monsonego J. ;2004,Evidence-Based Healthcare ; Question. How many additional cervical cancers would occur if annual screening reduced to screening 3 years after the last negative test? Study design. Outcomes analysis with Markov model using screening programme data. Main results. Among 32,230 women with ? 3 consecutive negative tests, none had cancer, 16 had grade 2 or three cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Among 938,576 women with no prior tests, 511 women had cancer. Cases were more common in women in whom fewer negative tests were performed. The model predicted that screening 3 years after the last negative test, rather than annually, would lead to five extra cases of cervical cancer in a cohort of 100,000 women aged under 30 years. Three extra cases among women aged 30-44 years, one extra case among women aged 45-59, and no additional cases among women aged 60-64, were predicted. Authors' conclusions. An average of three additional cases of cervical cancer per 100,000 is predicted if women between 30 and 64 years are screened 3 years after their last negative test, rather than annually for 3 years. ? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Screening effect of breast cancer incidence among the population of Bryansk and Orel oblasts of the Russian Federation,; Kashcheev V.V., Chekin S.Yu., Maksioutov M.A., Tumanov K.A., Korelo A.M., Kochergina E.V., Vlasov O.K., Shchukina N.V. ;2016,Radiation and Risk ; The study presents the estimations of screening effect for breast cancer among the population exposed as the result Chernobyl accident. The cohort selected for analysis consists of 127104 people from the most contaminated territories of Bryansk and Orel oblasts affected by the Chernobyl accident. Over the follow-up period 1996-2011, a total of 1164 breast cancer cases were identified as the result of annual compulsory health examination (1110 cases in Bryansk oblast and 54 cases in the Orel oblast). The study showed that the spontaneous cancer incidence of breast cancer among the population of Bryansk and Orel oblasts in the period from 1991 to 2011 was statistically lower (by 8%) than the level of incidence in Russia as a whole. Statistically significant screening effect on breast cancer detection was found in the most contaminated territories of Bryansk and Orel oblasts over the period 2006 to 2011.

Screening for Cervical Cancer in Primary Care: A Decision Analysis for the US Preventive Services Task Force.;Kim JJ1, Burger EA1,2, Regan C1, Sy S1.;JAMA. 2018 Aug 21.320(7):706-714. doi: 10.1001/jama.2017.19872.;Abstract IMPORTANCE: Evidence on the relative benefits and harms of primary high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) testing is needed to inform guidelines. OBJECTIVE: To inform the US Preventive Services Task Force by modeling the benefits and harms of various cervical cancer screening strategies. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Microsimulation model of a hypothetical cohort of women initiating screening at age 21 years. EXPOSURES: Screening with cytology, hrHPV testing, and cytology and hrHPV cotesting, varying age to switch from cytology to hrHPV testing or cotesting (25, 27, 30 years), rescreening interval (3, 5 years), and triage options for hrHPV-positive results (16/18 genotype, cytology testing). Current guidelines-based screening strategies comprised cytology alone every 3 years starting at age 21 years, with or without a switch to cytology and hrHPV cotesting every 5 years from ages 30 to 65 years. Complete adherence for all 19 strategies was assumed. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Lifetime number of tests, colposcopies, disease detection, false-positive results, cancer cases and deaths, life-years, and efficiency ratios expressing the trade-off of harms (ie, colposcopies, tests) vs benefits (life-years gained, cancer cases averted). Efficient strategies were those that yielded more benefit and less harm than another strategy or a lower harm to benefit ratio than a strategy with less harms. RESULTS: Compared with no screening, all modeled cervical cancer screening strategies were estimated to result in substantial reductions in cancer cases and deaths and gains in life-years. The effectiveness of screening across the different strategies was estimated to be similar, with primary hrHPV-based and alternative cotesting strategies having slightly higher effectiveness and greater harms than current guidelines-based cytology testing. For example, cervical cancer deaths associated with the guidelines-based strategies ranged from 0.30 to 0.76 deaths per 1000 women, whereas new strategies involving primary hrHPV testing or cotesting were associated with fewer cervical cancer deaths, ranging from 0.23 to 0.29 deaths per 1000 women. In all analyses, primary hrHPV testing strategies occurring at 5-year intervals were efficient. For example, 5-year primary hrHPV testing (cytology triage) based on switching from cytology to hrHPV screening at ages 30 years, 27 years, and 25 years had ratios per life-year gained of 73, 143, and 195 colposcopies, respectively. In contrast, strategies involving 3-year hrHPV testing had much higher ratios, ranging from 2188 to 3822 colposcopies per life-year gained. In most analyses, strategies involving cotesting were not efficient. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this microsimulation modeling study, it was estimated that primary hrHPV screening may represent a reasonable balance of harms and benefits when performed every 5 years. Switching from cytology to hrHPV testing at age 30 years yielded the most efficient harm to benefit ratio when using colposcopy as a proxy for harms.;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.,Adult,Advisory Committees,Aged,Cervix Uteri/pathology,Cervix Uteri/virology,Colposcopy/utilization,Decision Support Techniques*,Early Detection of Cancer*/methods,Female,Humans,Incidence,Life Expectancy,Mass Screening,Middle Aged,Papillomaviridae/isolation & purification*,Practice Guidelines as Topic*,Process Assessment (Health Care),United States,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/mortality,Vaginal Smears*,Young Adult,U01 CA199334/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;30140882;
Screening for Colorectal Cancer With Fecal Immunochemical Testing With and Without Postpolypectomy Surveillance Colonoscopy: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis.;Greuter MJE1, de Klerk CM1, Meijer GA1, Dekker E1, Coupƒ? VMH1.;Ann Intern Med. 2017 Oct 17.167(8):544-554. doi: 10.7326/M16-2891. Epub 2017 Oct 3.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Population-based screening to prevent colorectal cancer (CRC) death is effective, but the effectiveness of postpolypectomy surveillance is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the additional benefit in terms of cost-effectiveness of colonoscopy surveillance in a screening setting. DESIGN: Microsimulation using the ASCCA (Adenoma and Serrated pathway to Colorectal CAncer) model. DATA SOURCES: Dutch CRC screening program and published literature. TARGET POPULATION: Asymptomatic persons aged 55 to 75 years without a prior CRC diagnosis. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Health care payer. INTERVENTION: Fecal immunochemical test (FIT) screening with colonoscopy surveillance performed according to the Dutch guideline was simulated. The comparator was no screening or surveillance. FIT screening without colonoscopy surveillance and the effect of extending surveillance intervals were also evaluated. OUTCOME MEASURES: CRC burden, colonoscopy demand, life-years, and costs. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: FIT screening without surveillance reduced CRC mortality by 50.4% compared with no screening or surveillance. Adding surveillance to FIT screening reduced mortality by an additional 1.7% to 52.1% but increased lifetime colonoscopy demand by 62% (from 335 to 543 colonoscopies per 1000 persons) at an additional cost of ¢??68 000, for an increase of 0.9 life-year. Extending the surveillance intervals to 5 years reduced CRC mortality by 51.8% and increased colonoscopy demand by 42.7% compared with FIT screening without surveillance. In an incremental analysis, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for screening plus surveillance exceeded the Dutch willingness-to-pay threshold of ¢??36 602 per life-year gained. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: When using a parameter set representing low colorectal lesion prevalence or when colonoscopy costs were halved or colorectal lesion incidence was doubled, screening plus surveillance became cost-effective compared with screening without surveillance. LIMITATION: Limited data on FIT performance and background CRC risk in the surveillance population. CONCLUSION: Adding surveillance to FIT screening is not cost-effective based on the Dutch ICER threshold and substantially increases colonoscopy demand. Extending surveillance intervals to 5 years would decrease colonoscopy demand without substantial loss of effectiveness.

Screen-detected and interval primary invasive breast cancers (n=685, screened) were more often smaller (P<0.0001), localised (P<0.0001) and histologically better differentiated (grade I vs II-III, P<0.0001) than pre-screening cancers and cancers detected after the defined interval from the last screening (n=184, clinical). Survival was far better in the ""screened"" group than in the ""clinical"" group (P<0.0001, HR 2.55. CI 95% 1.77-3.67). Cox's multivariate analysis revealed axillary lymph node negativity (P<0.0001), histological grade I (P=0.0005) and size less than or equal to 20mm (P=0.0118) as explanations of the beneficial effect of screening.

METHODS: The main method was computer simulation with a Markov model that used published estimates of population size by age group, breast cancer prevalence and incidence, screening program participation rate, sensitivity and specificity of the screening test and diagnostic test, stage transition probabilities, directed diagnosis rates and costs. FINDINGS: The model predicted that changes to age eligibility requirements would result in the detection of an additional 6610 women with breast cancer in Ontario requiring treatment, at an additional cost of 795 Canadian per case. These costs include those related to screening, diagnosis and initial treatment and apply to the 20-year period.

Stage distribution at first and repeat examinations in breast cancer screening.;Boer R1, de Koning H, van Oortmarssen G, Warmerdam P, van der Maas P.;J Med Screen. 1999.6(3):132-8.;Abstract OBJECTIVES: To investigate observed stage distributions at first and repeat screenings. To compare the observed outcomes with expected values based on simulation modelling, varying the assumptions about the natural history of the disease. METHODS: An overview is made of observed data on stage distribution at first and repeat screenings and the difference between those distributions is summarised in a Gini coefficient. Four possible explanations for the observations are considered, two of these are worked out as Miscan simulation models, and the outcomes are compared with observations. RESULTS: Often the reported stage distributions at repeat screenings are not or only slightly more favourable than at first screenings and, in the ones that are more favourable, the difference is relatively small. If, in the Miscan model, it is assumed that there is no correlation between the duration of preclinical breast cancer in consecutive tumour size categories and that there is a strong influence of latent cancers, it is not possible to reproduce the observed outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The two modelled explanations are not sufficient. Decreasing sensitivity seems an unlikely explanation for the discrepancy in many screening programmes. The possibility that the observations may be explained because false reassurance has been given should be seriously considered and investigated.;Meta-Analysis,Adult,Aged,Breast Neoplasms/pathology*,Computer Simulation,Confidence Intervals,Disease Progression,Female,Humans,Mass Screening/methods*,Mass Screening/statistics & numerical data,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical,Neoplasm Staging/statistics & numerical data,Sensitivity and Specificity;10572843;
Strategic Distributional Cost-Effectiveness Analysis for Improving National Cancer Screening Uptake in Cervical Cancer: A Focus on Regional Inequality in South Korea.;Lee TH1,2, Kim W1,2, Shin J2,3, Park EC2,3, Park S2,4, Kim TH2,4.;Cancer Res Treat. 2018 Jan.50(1):212-221. doi: 10.4143/crt.2016.525. Epub 2017 Mar 30.;Abstract PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to conduct a cost effectiveness analysis of strategies designed to improve national cervical cancer screening rates, along with a distributional cost effectiveness analysis that considers regional disparities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cost effectiveness analysis was conducted using a Markov cohort simulation model, with quality adjusted life years as the unit of effectiveness. The strategies considered were current (biennial Papanicolaou smear cytology of females aged 20 or above), strong screening recommendation by mail to target regions (effect, 12% increase in screening uptake. cost, 1,000 Korean won per person), regular universal screening recommendation by mail (effect, 6% increase in screening uptake. cost, 500 Korean won per person), and strong universal screening recommendation by mail (effect, 12% increase in screening uptake. cost, 1,000 Korean won per person). Distributional cost effectiveness analysis was conducted by calculating the cost effectiveness of strategies using the Atkinson incremental cost effectiveness ratio. RESULTS: All strategies were under the threshold value, which was set as the Korean gross domestic product of $25,990. In particular, the 'strong screening recommendation to target regions' strategy was found to be the most cost effective (incremental cost effectiveness ratio, 7,361,145 Korean won). This was also true when societal inequality aversion increased in the distributional cost effectiveness analysis. CONCLUSION: The 'strong screening recommendation to target regions' strategy was the most cost effective approach, even when adjusting for inequality. As efficiency and equity are objectives concurrently sought in healthcare, these findings imply a need to develop appropriate economic evaluation methodologies to assess healthcare policies.;Adult,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Cohort Studies,Cost-Benefit Analysis/methods*,Female,Humans,Mass Screening,Middle Aged,Republic of Korea,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/economics*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/pathology,Young Adult;28361522;

The cost-effectiveness of cervical screening in Australia: what is the impact of screening at different intervals or over a different age range?;Anderson R1, Haas M, Shanahan M.;Aust N Z J Public Health. 2008 Feb.32(1):43-52. doi: 10.1111/j.1753-6405.2008.00165.x.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of altering the currently recommended interval and age range for cervical screening of Australian women. METHODS: The cost and effectiveness estimates of alternative screening strategies were generated using an established decision model. This model incorporated a Markov model (of the natural history of cervical cancer and pre-cancerous lesions) and decision trees which: 'mapped' the various pathways to cervical cancer screening. the follow-up of abnormal Pap test results. and the management of confirmed lesions. The model simulated a hypothetical large cohort of Australian women from age 15 to age 85 and calculated the accumulated costs and life-years under each screening strategy. RESULTS: Our model estimated that moving from the current two-yearly screening strategy to annual screening (over the same age range) would cost $379,300 per additional life-year saved. Moving from the current strategy to three-yearly screening would yield $117,100 of savings per life-year lost (costs and effects both discounted at 5% per year), with a relatively modest (<5%) reduction in the total number of life-years saved by the program. CONCLUSIONS: Although moving to annual screening would save some additional lives, it is not a cost-effective strategy. Consideration should be given to increasing the recommended interval for cervical screening. However, the net value of any such shift to less effective (e.g. less frequent) and less costly screening strategies will require better evidence about the cost-effectiveness of strategies that encourage non-screeners or irregular screeners to have a Pap test more regularly.;Adolescent,Adult,Age Factors,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Australia,Cost Savings,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Decision Support Techniques,Decision Trees,Female,Humans,Markov Chains,Mass Screening/economics*,Middle Aged,Program Evaluation,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/economics;18290913;
The cost-effectiveness of immunochemical tests for colorectal cancer screening.;Lejeune C1, Le Gleut K2, Cottet V3, Galimard C4, Durand G2, Dancourt V3, Faivre J3.;Dig Liver Dis. 2014 Jan.46(1):76-81. doi: 10.1016/j.dld.2013.07.018. Epub 2013 Sep 4.;Abstract BACKGROUND: The optimal immunochemical test to use for generalised mass screening is still under debate in France. AIM: To compare the cost and effectiveness in biennial screening for colorectal cancer of fifteen strategies consisting of the three-stool sample un-rehydrated guaiac faecal occult blood test and three immunochemical tests: Magstream, FOB-Gold and OC-Sensor, at different positivity cut-off levels and stool-sample collection. METHODS: A Markov model was used to compare these strategies in a general population of 100,000 individuals aged 50-74 over a 20-year period. RESULTS: Immunochemical tests were efficient strategies compared with guaiac faecal occult blood test. When all 15 strategies were compared with each other, only five of them remained efficient: the one- and two-stool sample Magstream, the one- and two-stool sample FOB-Gold with the 176 ng/mL cut-off, and the two-stool sample OC-Sensor with the 150 ng/mL cut-off. Sensitivity analyses showed that, at an identical price, the one-stool sample OC-Sensor was the most efficient strategy, and outperformed FOB-Gold. CONCLUSION: One-stool immunochemical testing can be considered a promising alternative to the guaiac faecal occult blood test for colorectal cancer mass screening in the general population. Competition between manufacturers should now be introduced to reduce purchase price differences. Copyright ‚? 2013 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The cost-effectiveness of screening for colorectal cancer.;;CMAJ. 2010 Sep 7.182(12):1307-13. doi: 10.1503/cmaj.090845. Epub 2010 Jul 12.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Published decision analyses show that screening for colorectal cancer is cost-effective. However, because of the number of tests available, the optimal screening strategy in Canada is unknown. We estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness of 10 strategies for colorectal cancer screening, as well as no screening, incorporating quality of life, noncompliance and data on the costs and benefits of chemotherapy. METHODS: We used a probabilistic Markov model to estimate the costs and quality-adjusted life expectancy of 50-year-old average-risk Canadians without screening and with screening by each test. We populated the model with data from the published literature. We calculated costs from the perspective of a third-party payer, with inflation to 2007 Canadian dollars. RESULTS: Of the 10 strategies considered, we focused on three tests currently being used for population screening in some Canadian provinces: low-sensitivity guaiac fecal occult blood test, performed annually. fecal immunochemical test, performed annually. and colonoscopy, performed every 10 years. These strategies reduced the incidence of colorectal cancer by 44%, 65% and 81%, and mortality by 55%, 74% and 83%, respectively, compared with no screening. These strategies generated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of $9159, $611 and $6133 per quality-adjusted life year, respectively. The findings were robust to probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Colonoscopy every 10 years yielded the greatest net health benefit. INTERPRETATION: Screening for colorectal cancer is cost-effective over conventional levels of willingness to pay.

The Cost-Effectiveness of Visual Triage of Human Papillomavirus-Positive Women in Three Low- and Middle-Income Countries.;Campos NG1, Jeronimo J2, Tsu V2, Castle PE3,4, Mvundura M5, Kim JJ6.;Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2017 Oct.26(10):1500-1510. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-16-0787. Epub 2017 Jul 14.;Abstract Background: World Health Organization guidelines support human papillomavirus (HPV) testing alone (followed by treatment with cryotherapy) or in conjunction with visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) triage testing. Our objective was to determine the cost-effectiveness of VIA triage for HPV-positive women in low-resource settings.Methods: We calibrated mathematical simulation models of HPV infection and cervical cancer to epidemiologic data from India, Nicaragua, and Uganda. Using cost and test performance data from the START-UP demonstration projects, we assumed screening took place either once or three times in a lifetime between ages 30 and 40 years. Strategies included (i) HPV al followed by cryotherapy for all eligible HPV-positive women. and (ii) HPV testing with VIA triage for HPV-positive women, followed by cryotherapy for eligible women who were also VIA-positive (HPV-VIA). Model outcomes included lifetime risk of cervical cancer and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs. international dollars/year of life saved).Results: In all three countries, HPV alone was more effective than HPV-VIA. In Nicaragua and Uganda, HPV alone was also less costly than HPV-VIA. ICERs associated with screening three times in a lifetime (HPV alone) were below per capita GDP. In India, both HPV alone and HPV-VIA had ICERs below per capita GDP.Conclusions: VIA triage of HPV-positive women is not likely to be cost-effective in settings with high cervical cancer burden. HPV alone followed by treatment may achieve greater health benefits and value for public health dollars.Impact: This study provides early evidence on the cost-effectiveness of HPV testing followed by VIA triage versus an HPV screen-and-treat strategy.

The cost-utility of integrated cervical cancer prevention strategies in the Ontario setting - Can we do better?;;Vaccine. 2016 Apr 7.34(16):1936-44. doi: 10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.02.016. Epub 2016 Feb 15.;Abstract INTRODUCTION: A universal, publicly funded, school-based human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination program in grade eight girls was initiated in Ontario in 2007. We present a cost-utility analysis of integrated cervical cancer prevention programs from the healthcare payer perspective. METHODS: Our analysis was based on linked HPV transmission and disease history models. We obtained data from the literature, provincial surveys and Ontario population-based linked health administrative datasets. We modeled combinations of vaccination and screening strategies. We considered vaccination based on the Ontario experience, as well as conservative and optimistic scenarios, varying coverage, vaccine effectiveness and duration of protection. We considered 900 screening scenarios (screening start age: 21-70 years, screening interval: 3-20 years. 1-year time steps). The current schedule screens every 3 years starting at age 21 years. We examined (1) first vaccinated cohort (low herd-immunity), and (2) steady state, i.e. all cohorts were vaccinated (high herd-immunity). RESULTS: Adding vaccination to the current screening schedule was cost-effective (<C$10,000/quality-adjusted life year (QALY)) across all scenarios. Delaying screening start and/or extending screening intervals increased both expected QALYs and cost, and increased overall NHB for screening schedules with a start age of 25-35 years and 3-10-year intervals for most scenarios. CONCLUSION: Delaying screening start age and/or extending screening intervals in vaccinated cohorts is likely to be cost-effective. Consideration should be given to both the short- and long-term implications of health policy decisions, particularly for infectious disease interventions that require long time intervals to reach steady state.

The Economic Evaluation of Lung Cancer Screening Using a System Model,; Koinuma N. ;2003,Japanese Journal of Lung Cancer ; Economic evaluation in cancer screening is increasingly used to help clinicians and policy makers make sound and rational decisions. This is a useful tool that gives us the information on the effects of health programs and of alternative options in terms of their costs, consequences and benefits. This is to clarify the present and future relationship between the input resources and economic effects of lung cancer control programs for developing evidence-based health policy and for improving the quality of health services. We developed a system model of cancer prognosis, similar to the Markov Model, and analyzed the balance of patient labor productivity (Benefit) and accumulated cancer care costs including screening costs (Cost). Such parameters as distribution of stages, probability of progress, 5-year-survival and medical costs of survivors were collected for the model. The cost-benefit ratios, expected survival years, costs per QALYs, costs of lifesaving, death rate (mortality/morbidity) and also the simulated future changes were calculated in the model. It costs 2-4 times in the lung cancer screening for the age of 40's in compared with that of 50's. The proportion of in total expenditure in lung cancer control program will be approximately 30-40% even in 2010, while the relatively better result from 50 to 70% will be appeared in other cancers. It was proven that the drastic increase of total medical costs in the future would hardly influence the balance itself. ; Cancer screening, Cost-benefit analysis, Economic evaluation, Lifesaving cost, System model, article, cancer control, cancer mortality, cancer screening, cancer survival, cost benefit analysis, economic evaluation, economics, health care cost, health care ;;
The economic evaluation of screening for colorectal cancer: Case of Iran.;;Clin Lab. 2013.59(5-6):667-74.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Given increasing rates of colorectal cancer (CRC) in countries with intermediate incidence rates, the decision to implement population-based screening must consider the trade-off between high costs and a relatively low yield. We estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 10 strategies for colorectal cancer screening, as well as no screening, incorporating quality of life, noncompliance, and data on the costs and benefits of chemotherapy in Iran. METHODS: We used a Markov model to measure the costs and quality-adjusted life expectancy of 50-year-old average-risk Iranian without screening and with screening by each test. In this study, we populated the model with data from the ministry of health and published literature. We considered costs from the perspective of a health insurance organization, with inflation to the 2011 Iranian Rial converted to US dollars. We focused on three tests of the 10 strategies considered, currently being used for population screening in some Iranian provinces (Mazandaran Kerman, Golestan, Ardabil, and Tehran): low-sensitivity guaiac fecal occult blood test, performed annually. fecal immunochemical test, performed annually. and colonoscopy, performed every 10 years. RESULTS: These strategies reduced the incidence of colorectal cancer by 39%, 60%, and 76% and mortality by 50%, 69%, and 78%, respectively, compared with no screening. These strategies generated ICER (incremental cost-effectiveness ratios) of $9067, $654, and $8700 per QALY (quality-adjusted life year), respectively. Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the influence of various parameters on the cost-effectiveness of screening. The results were robust to probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Colonoscopy every 10 years yielded the greatest net health benefit. CONCLUSIONS: Screening for colorectal cancer is cost-effective over conventional levels of WTP (Willingness to Pay).

The health and economic impact of scaling cervical cancer prevention in 50 low- and lower-middle-income countries.;;Int J Gynaecol Obstet. 2017 Jul.138 Suppl 1:47-56. doi: 10.1002/ijgo.12184.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: To estimate the health impact, financial costs, and cost-effectiveness of scaling-up coverage of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination (young girls) and cervical cancer screening (women of screening age) for women in countries that will likely need donor assistance. METHODS: We used a model-based approach to synthesize population, demographic, and epidemiological data from 50 low- and lower-middle-income countries. Models were used to project the costs (US $), lifetime health impact (cervical cancer cases, deaths averted), and cost-effectiveness (US $ per disability adjusted life year [DALY] averted) of: (1) two-dose HPV-16/18 vaccination of girls aged 10 years. (2) once-in-a-lifetime screening, with treatment when needed, of women aged 35 years with either HPV DNA testing or visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA). and (3) cervical cancer treatment over a 10-year roll-out. RESULTS: We estimated that both HPV vaccination and screening would be very cost-effective, and a comprehensive program could avert 5.2 million cases, 3.7 million deaths, and 22.0 million DALYs over the lifetimes of the intervention cohorts for a total 10-year program cost of US $3.2 billion. CONCLUSION: Investment in HPV vaccination of young girls and cervical cancer screen-and-treat programs in low- and lower-middle-income countries could avert a substantial burden of disease while providing good value for public health dollars. ¯õ? 2017 The Authors.

The impact of immunochemical faecal occult blood testing on colorectal cancer incidence.;;Dig Liver Dis. 2014 Jan.46(1):82-6. doi: 10.1016/j.dld.2013.07.017. Epub 2013 Sep 4.;"Abstract BACKGROUND: The efficacy of colorectal cancer screening based on faecal immunochemical test, in terms of reduction of colorectal cancer incidence, is under debate. In the district of Florence, an organized screening programme based on faecal immunochemical test has been running since the early 1990s. The aim of this study was to compare the risk of developing colorectal cancer for subjects undergoing faecal immunochemical test with those who did not undergo the test in the same period. METHODS: Two cohorts were analyzed: subjects who underwent an initial faecal immunochemical test between 1993 and 1999 (""attenders""), and unscreened residents in the same municipalities invited to perform the faecal immunochemical test in the same period (""non-attenders""). Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analysis were performed to evaluate the risk of developing colorectal cancer. RESULTS: The attenders' and non-attenders' cohorts included 6961 and 26,285 subjects, respectively. Cox analysis showed a reduction in colorectal cancer incidence of 22% in the attenders' compared to the non-attenders' cohort (hazard ratio = 0.78, 95% Confidence Interval: 0.65-0.93). CONCLUSION: Our results support the hypothesis that screening based on a single faecal immunochemical test every 2 years produces a significant decrease in colorectal cancer incidence after an average follow-up observation period of 11 years.

The impact of stratifying by family history in colorectal cancer screening programs.;;Int J Cancer. 2015 Sep 1.137(5):1119-27. doi: 10.1002/ijc.29473. Epub 2015 Feb 20.;Abstract In the province-wide colorectal cancer (CRC) screening program in Ontario, Canada, individuals with a family history of CRC are offered colonoscopy screening and those without are offered guaiac fecal occult blood testing (gFOBT, Hemoccult II). We used microsimulation modeling to estimate the cumulative number of CRC deaths prevented and colonoscopies performed between 2008 and 2038 with this family history-based screening program, compared to a regular gFOBT program. In both programs, we assumed screening uptake increased from 30% (participation level in 2008 before the program was launched) to 60%. We assumed that 11% of the population had a family history, defined as having at least one first-degree relative diagnosed with CRC. The programs offered screening between age 50 and 74 years, every two years for gFOBT, and every ten years for colonoscopy. Compared to opportunistic screening (2008 participation level kept constant at 30%), the gFOBT program cumulatively prevented 6,700 more CRC deaths and required 570,000 additional colonoscopies by 2038. The family history-based screening program increased these numbers to 9,300 and 1,100,000, a 40% and 93% increase, respectively. If biennial gFOBT was replaced with biennial fecal immunochemical test (FIT), annual Hemoccult Sensa or five-yearly sigmoidoscopy screening, both the added benefits and colonoscopies required would decrease. A biennial gFOBT screening program that identifies individuals with a family history of CRC and recommends them to undergo colonoscopy screening would prevent 40% (range in sensitivity analyses: 20-51%) additional deaths while requiring 93% (range: 43-116%) additional colonoscopies, compared to a regular gFOBT screening program.;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Aged,Canada,Colonoscopy/methods*,Colorectal Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Colorectal Neoplasms/epidemiology,Early Detection of Cancer/methods*,Humans,Mass Screening/methods,Middle Aged,Occult Blood*,Pedigree,U01 CA152959/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,U01-CA-152959/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,U01 CA115953/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,U01 CA097426/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,U01-CA-115953/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,CST-85478/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada,U01-CA-097426/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;25663135;

The influence of disease risk on the optimal time interval between screens for the early detection of cancer: a mathematical approach.;O'Mahony JF1,2, van Rosmalen J1,3, Mushkudiani NA4, Goudsmit FW1, Eijkemans MJ5, Heijnsdijk EA1, Steyerberg EW1, Habbema JD1.;Med Decis Making. 2015 Feb.35(2):183-95. doi: 10.1177/0272989X14528380. Epub 2014 Apr 16.;Abstract The intervals between screens for the early detection of diseases such as breast and colon cancer suggested by screening guidelines are typically based on the average population risk of disease. With the emergence of ever more biomarkers for cancer risk prediction and the development of personalized medicine, there is a need for risk-specific screening intervals. The interval between successive screens should be shorter with increasing cancer risk. A risk-dependent optimal interval is ideally derived from a cost-effectiveness analysis using a validated simulation model. However, this is time-consuming and costly. We propose a simplified mathematical approach for the exploratory analysis of the implications of risk level on optimal screening interval. We develop a mathematical model of the optimal screening interval for breast cancer screening. We verified the results by programming the simplified model in the MISCAN-Breast microsimulation model and comparing the results. We validated the results by comparing them with the results of a full, published MISCAN-Breast cost-effectiveness model for a number of different risk levels. The results of both the verification and validation were satisfactory. We conclude that the mathematical approach can indicate the impact of disease risk on the optimal screening interval.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Validation Studies,Aged,Biomarkers, Tumor,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis,Breast Neoplasms/economics,Computer Simulation,Cost-Benefit Analysis*,Early Detection of Cancer*/economics,Female,Humans,Incidence,Mammography/economics,Middle Aged,Models, Theoretical*,Precision Medicine,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,Risk Factors,Sensitivity and Specificity,Switzerland,Time Factors,Biomarkers, Tumor;24739535;
The influence of waiting times on cost-effectiveness: a case study of colorectal cancer mass screening.;Chauvin P1, Josselin JM, Heresbach D.;Eur J Health Econ. 2014 Nov.15(8):801-12. doi: 10.1007/s10198-013-0525-9. Epub 2013 Aug 22.;Abstract When a cost-effectiveness analysis is implemented, the health-care system is usually assumed to adjust smoothly to the proposed new strategy. However, technological innovations in health care may often induce friction in the organization of care supply, implying the congestion of services and subsequent waiting times. Our objective here is to measure how these short run rigidities can challenge cost-effectiveness recommendations favorable to an innovative mass screening test for colorectal cancer. Using Markov modeling, we compare the standard Guaiac fecal occult blood test (gFOBT) with an innovative screening test for colorectal cancer, namely the immunological fecal occult blood test (iFOBT). Waiting time can occur between a positive screening test and the subsequent confirmation colonoscopy. Five scenarios are considered for iFOBT: no further waiting time compared with gFOBT, twice as much waiting time for a period of 5 or 10 years, and twice as much waiting time for a period of 5 or 10 years combined with a 25% decrease in participation to confirmation colonoscopies. According to our modeling, compared with gFOBT, iFOBT would approximately double colonoscopy demand. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis enables concluding that the waiting time significantly increases the uncertainty surrounding recommendations favorable to iFOBT if it induces a decrease in the adherence rate for confirmation colonoscopy.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Age Factors,Aged,Colonoscopy/economics,Colonoscopy/statistics & numerical data,Colorectal Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Colorectal Neoplasms/economics,Colorectal Neoplasms/epidemiology,Cost-Benefit Analysis/statistics & numerical data*,Female,Humans,Male,Markov Chains,Mass Screening/economics*,Mass Screening/statistics & numerical data,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical,Occult Blood,Patient Compliance/statistics & numerical data,Sex Factors,Waiting Lists*;23974962;

The natural history of breast cancer: implications for a screening strategy.;;Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1990 Nov.19(5):1117-20.;Abstract In the data base of the Institut Gustave-Roussy, the clinical courses of over 7000 patients treated since 1951 are registered. For 3000 of them treated prior to the introduction of adjuvant chemotherapy, the follow-up ranges from 15 to 32 years. For all patients, the size of the primary tumor, its histologic grade, and the number of involved axillary nodes at the time of initial treatment were registered prospectively. This series of patients was used to analyze the relationship between the size of the primary tumor and the probability of distant metastatic spread, taking into account other prognostic variables. A simulation model of the natural history of breast cancer was built which satisfactorily fits the available data on breast cancer screening. The aim of this paper is to use this model to assess the influence of: a) the time interval between mammographies and b) the diagnostic ability of the screening program, on the proportion of patients with distant metastases. The results show that the proportion of patients with distant metastases at the time of diagnosis increases gradually from approximately 25% for an interval of 1 year to 40% for an interval of 5 years. Moreover, the proportion of patients with metastases is critically influenced by the size of the tumors which can be detected. for example, for a 2-year interval the proportion of patients with metastases increases from 32% for tumors screened of 1 cm in diameter to 40% for tumors of 1.7 cm in diameter.;Breast Neoplasms/pathology*,Breast Neoplasms/prevention & control,Female,Humans,Mammography*,Mass Screening*,Neoplasm Metastasis/pathology,Neoplasm Metastasis/prevention & control;2254099;
The potential harms of primary human papillomavirus screening in over-screened women: a microsimulation study.;Naber SK1, de Kok IM2, Matthijsse SM2, van Ballegooijen M2.;Cancer Causes Control. 2016 Apr.27(4):569-81. doi: 10.1007/s10552-016-0732-7. Epub 2016 Mar 12.;Abstract BACKGROUND: It is well acknowledged that HPV testing should not be performed at young age and at short intervals. Cytological screening practices have shown that over-screening, i.e., from a younger age and at shorter intervals than recommended, is hard to avoid. We quantified the consequences of a switch to primary HPV screening for over-screened women, taking into account its higher sensitivity but lower specificity than cytology. METHODS: The health effects of using the HPV test instead of cytology as the primary screening method were determined with the MISCAN-Cervix model. We varied the age women start screening and the interval between screens. In the sensitivity analyses, we varied the background risk of cervical cancer, the HPV prevalence, the discount rate, the triage strategy after cytology, and the test characteristics of both cytology and the HPV test. RESULTS: For women screened 5 yearly from age 30, 32 extra deaths per 100,000 simulated women were prevented when switching from primary cytology to primary HPV testing. For annual screening from age 20, such a switch resulted in 6 extra deaths prevented. It was associated with 9,044 more positive primary screens in the former scenario versus 76,480 in the latter. Under all conditions, for women screened annually, switching to HPV screening resulted in a net loss of quality-adjusted life years. CONCLUSION: For over-screened women, the harms associated with a lower test specificity outweigh the life years gained when switching from primary cytology to primary HPV testing. The extent of over-screening should be considered when deciding on inclusion of primary HPV screening in cervical cancer screening guidelines.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Cytodiagnosis,Early Detection of Cancer/methods*,Female,Humans,Mass Screening/methods*,Papillomavirus Infections/diagnosis*,Papillomavirus Infections/virology,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,Sensitivity and Specificity,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/virology*,Young Adult;26970740;
The predicted effect of changes in cervical screening practice in the UK: results from a modelling study.;Canfell K1, Barnabas R, Patnick J, Beral V.;Br J Cancer. 2004 Aug 2.91(3):530-6.;Abstract In 2003, the National Health Service Cervical Screening Programme (NHSCSP) announced that its screening interval would be reduced to 3 years in women aged 25-49 and fixed at 5 years in those aged 50-64, and that women under 25 years will no longer be invited for screening. In order to assess these and possible further changes to cervical screening practice in the UK, we constructed a mathematical model of cervical HPV infection, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and invasive cervical cancer, and of UK age-specific screening coverage rates, screening intervals and treatment efficacy. The predicted cumulative lifetime incidence of invasive cervical cancer in the UK is 1.70% in the absence of screening and 0.77% with pre-2003 screening practice. A reduction in lifetime incidence to 0.63% is predicted following the implementation of the 2003 NHSCSP recommendations, which represents a 63% reduction compared to incidence rates in the UK population if it were unscreened. The model suggests that, after the implementation of the 2003 recommendations, increasing the sensitivity of the screening test regime from its current average value of 56 to 90% would further reduce the cumulative lifetime incidence of invasive cervical cancer to 0.46%. Alternatively, extending screening to women aged 65-79 years would further reduce the lifetime incidence to 0.56%. Screening women aged 20-25 years would have minimal impact, with the cumulative lifetime incidence decreasing from 0.63 to 0.61%.

The relation of breast cancer staging to screening protocol compliance: a computer simulation study.;Castro F1, Carter KJ, Kessler E, Erickson BA, Kseibi SA.;Comput Biol Med. 2005 Feb.35(2):91-101.;Abstract A computer model based on relational database techniques was used to analyze the relationship between staging and population compliance to a breast cancer screening protocol. Stage distribution data permitted estimates of compliance to the protocol. This relationship followed the equation y=5.83e-2.44x where y was compliance and x was disease stage. Application of this equation to SEER and NCDB data estimated that the levels of compliance never exceeded 16 percent. Results indicated increasing clinical Stage IV disease as population compliance decreased. As the clinical staging increased there was increased sub-clinical Stage IV disease. With regular screening, simulation suggested that mortality would decrease.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Breast Neoplasms/pathology*,Clinical Protocols,Computer Simulation*,Female,Humans,Mammography,Mass Screening/standards,Middle Aged,Models, Theoretical*,Neoplasm Staging/methods*,Patient Compliance*;15567180;
The role of physician reminders in faecal occult blood testing for colorectal cancer screening.;;Eur J Gen Pract. 2011 Dec.17(4):221-8. doi: 10.3109/13814788.2011.601412. Epub 2011 Aug 23.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer screening in the form of faecal occult blood (FOB) testing can significantly reduce the burden of this disease and has been used as early as the 1970s. Effective involvement of GPs along with reminding physicians prior to seeing a patient may improve uptake. OBJECTIVE: This article is a systematic review of published literature examining the uptake of FOB testing after physician reminders as part of the colorectal cancer screening process. METHODS: Electronic databases were searched from January 1975 to October 2010. All studies comparing physician reminders (Rem) with controls (NRem) were identified. A meta-analysis was performed to obtain a summary outcome. RESULTS: Five comparative studies involving 25 287 patients were analyzed. There were 12 641 patients were in the Rem and 12 646 in the NRem group. All five studies obtained a higher percentage uptake when physician reminders were given. However, in only two of the studies were the percentage uptake significantly higher. There was significant heterogeneity among trials (I2 = 95%). The combined increase in FOB test uptake was not statistically significant (random effects model: risk difference = 6.6%, 95% CI: -2-14.7%. z = 1.59, P = 0.112). CONCLUSION: Reminding physicians about those patients due for FOB testing may not improve the effectiveness of a colorectal cancer screening programme. Further studies are required and should focus on areas where there is a lower baseline uptake and areas with high levels of deprivation.;Meta-Analysis,Review,Colorectal Neoplasms/diagnosis*,General Practitioners/organization & administration,General Practitioners/statistics & numerical data,Humans,Mass Screening/methods,Models, Statistical,Occult Blood*,Patient Acceptance of Health Care/statistics & numerical data,Physician's Role,Practice Patterns, Physicians'/statistics & numerical data,Reminder Systems*;21861598;
The University of Rochester model of breast cancer detection and survival.;Hanin LG1, Miller A, Zorin AV, Yakovlev AY.;J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr. 2006.(36):66-78.;Abstract This paper presents a biologically motivated model of breast cancer development and detection allowing for arbitrary screening schedules and the effects of clinical covariates recorded at the time of diagnosis on posttreatment survival. Biologically meaningful parameters of the model are estimated by the method of maximum likelihood from the data on age and tumor size at detection that resulted from two randomized trials known as the Canadian National Breast Screening Studies. When properly calibrated, the model provides a good description of the U.S. national trends in breast cancer incidence and mortality. The model was validated by predicting some quantitative characteristics obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data. In particular, the model provides an excellent prediction of the size-specific age-adjusted incidence of invasive breast cancer as a function of calendar time for 1975-1999. Predictive properties of the model are also illustrated with an application to the dynamics of age-specific incidence and stage-specific age-adjusted incidence over 1975-1999.;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Age Factors,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/mortality*,Breast Neoplasms/therapy,Canada/epidemiology,Cohort Studies,Female,Humans,Incidence,Mammography/statistics & numerical data,Mass Screening/statistics & numerical data,Models, Statistical*,Neoplasm Invasiveness,Neoplasm Staging,Predictive Value of Tests,Reproducibility of Results,Sensitivity and Specificity,Survival Rate,N01-PC-67000/PC/NCI NIH HHS/United States,U01 CA88177/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;17032896;

The value of colonoscopic colorectal cancer screening of adults aged 50 to 64.;;Am J Manag Care. 2015 Jul 1.21(7):e430-8.;Abstract OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine the value of life-years saved due to colorectal cancer (CRC) screening with colonoscopy for the population aged 50 to 64 years. The cost perspective is that of a private (commercial) insurer, while the value perspective includes survival past age 65 years, when most of the US population is insured by Medicare. We focused on colonoscopy because it is not only diagnostic but also therapeutic. because positive results on other screening tests generally are followed up with colonoscopy. and to build on previous study results that colonoscopy is ultimately more cost-effective than other screening, even considering its expense. STUDY DESIGN: Monte Carlo simulation. METHODS: Using a large multi-state cancer registry, a large national administrative claims database, and a model of CRC development based on published clinical literature, we estimated the impact of screening with colonoscopy on incidence of CRC, aggregate cost of colonoscopies and CRC, and life-years saved. RESULTS: Assuming 2013 commercial reimbursement rates for screening and treatment, we found that increasing screening adherence from 50% to 100% would cost about $3 per member per month (2013 US$) and reduce CRC treatment costs by about $1 per member per month. The cost per life-year saved is approximately $12,000, an amount that is much lower than for cervical or breast cancer screening and comparable to lung cancer screening. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that commercial insurers and employers should promote CRC screening as a high-value service. Promoting such screening through high-quality, low-cost providers would be an exemplar of efficient system innovation.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Colonoscopy/economics*,Colorectal Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Colorectal Neoplasms/economics*,Colorectal Neoplasms/epidemiology,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Early Detection of Cancer/economics*,Early Detection of Cancer/methods,Female,Humans,Insurance Claim Review,Male,Middle Aged,Monte Carlo Method,United States;26295271;
The Wisconsin Breast Cancer Epidemiology Simulation Model.;;J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr. 2006.(36):37-47.;"Abstract The Wisconsin Breast Cancer Epidemiology Simulation Model is a discrete-event, stochastic simulation model using a systems-science modeling approach to replicate breast cancer incidence and mortality in the U.S. population from 1975 to 2000. Four interacting processes are modeled over time: (1) natural history of breast cancer, (2) breast cancer detection, (3) breast cancer treatment, and (4) competing cause mortality. These components form a complex interacting system simulating the lives of 2.95 million women (approximately 1/50 the U.S. population) from 1950 to 2000 in 6-month cycles. After a ""burn in"" of 25 years to stabilize prevalent occult cancers, the model outputs age-specific incidence rates by stage and age-specific mortality rates from 1975 to 2000. The model simulates occult as well as detected disease at the individual level and can be used to address ""What if?"" questions about effectiveness of screening and treatment protocols, as well as to estimate benefits to women of specific ages and screening histories.";Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.,Adult,Age Distribution,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis,Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy,Breast Neoplasms/mortality*,Chemotherapy, Adjuvant,Cohort Studies,Computer Simulation*,Cross-Sectional Studies,Female,Humans,Incidence,Mammography/statistics & numerical data,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical*,Predictive Value of Tests,Risk Factors,Sensitivity and Specificity,Stochastic Processes,Survival Rate,United States/epidemiology,Wisconsin,U01CA82004/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,T32 HS00083/HS/AHRQ HHS/United States,T32 HS000083/HS/AHRQ HHS/United States,U01CA88211/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,HS000083/HS/AHRQ HHS/United States,P30CA14520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;17032893;
Tipping the balance of benefits and harms to favor screening mammography starting at age 40 years: a comparative modeling study of risk.;van Ravesteyn NT1, Miglioretti DL, Stout NK, Lee SJ, Schechter CB, Buist DS, Huang H, Heijnsdijk EA, Trentham-Dietz A, Alagoz O, Near AM, Kerlikowske K, Nelson HD, Mandelblatt JS, de Koning HJ.;Ann Intern Med. 2012 May 1.156(9):609-17. doi: 10.7326/0003-4819-156-9-201205010-00002.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Timing of initiation of screening for breast cancer is controversial in the United States. OBJECTIVE: To determine the threshold relative risk (RR) at which the harm-benefit ratio of screening women aged 40 to 49 years equals that of biennial screening for women aged 50 to 74 years. DESIGN: Comparative modeling study. DATA SOURCES: Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program, Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium, and medical literature. TARGET POPULATION: A contemporary cohort of women eligible for routine screening. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTION: Mammography screening starting at age 40 versus 50 years with different screening methods (film, digital) and screening intervals (annual, biennial). OUTCOME MEASURES: BENEFITS: life-years gained, breast cancer deaths averted. harms: false-positive mammography findings. harm-benefit ratios: false-positive findings/life-years gained, false-positive findings/deaths averted. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Screening average-risk women aged 50 to 74 years biennially yields the same false-positive findings/life-years gained as biennial screening with digital mammography starting at age 40 years for women with a 2-fold increased risk above average (median threshold RR, 1.9 [range across models, 1.5 to 4.4]). The threshold RRs are higher for annual screening with digital mammography (median, 4.3 [range, 3.3 to 10]) and when false-positive findings/deaths averted is used as an outcome measure instead of false-positive findings/life-years gained. The harm-benefit ratio for film mammography is more favorable than for digital mammography because film has a lower false-positive rate. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: The threshold RRs changed slightly when a more comprehensive measure of harm was used and were relatively insensitive to lower adherence assumptions. LIMITATION: Risk was assumed to influence onset of disease without influencing screening performance. CONCLUSION: Women aged 40 to 49 years with a 2-fold increased risk have similar harm-benefit ratios for biennial screening mammography as average-risk women aged 50 to 74 years. Threshold RRs required for favorable harm-benefit ratios vary by screening method, interval, and outcome measure.

To expand coverage, or increase frequency: Quantifying the tradeoffs between equity and efficiency facing cervical cancer screening programs in low-resource settings.;Campos NG1, Tsu V2, Jeronimo J2, Mvundura M3, Lee K1,4, Kim JJ1.;Int J Cancer. 2017 Mar 15.140(6):1293-1305. doi: 10.1002/ijc.30551.;Abstract Cervical cancer is a leading cause of cancer death worldwide, with 85% of the disease burden residing in less developed regions. To inform evidence-based decision-making as cervical cancer screening programs are planned, implemented, and scaled in low- and middle-income countries, we used cost and test performance data from the START-UP demonstration project in Uganda and a microsimulation model of HPV infection and cervical carcinogenesis to quantify the health benefits, distributional equity, cost-effectiveness, and financial impact of either (1) improving access to cervical cancer screening or (2) increasing the number of lifetime screening opportunities for women who already have access. We found that when baseline screening coverage was low (i.e., 30%), expanding coverage of screening once in a lifetime to 50% can yield comparable reductions in cancer risk to screening two or three times in a lifetime at 30% coverage, lead to greater reductions in health disparities, and cost 150 international dollars (I$) per year of life saved (YLS). At higher baseline screening coverage levels (i.e., 70%), screening three times in a lifetime yielded greater health benefits than expanding screening once in a lifetime to 90% coverage, and would have a cost-effectiveness ratio (I$590 per YLS) below Uganda's per capita GDP. Given very low baseline coverage at present, we conclude that a policy focus on increasing access for previously unscreened women appears to be more compatible with improving both equity and efficiency than a focus on increasing frequency for a small subset of women.;Adult,Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/diagnosis,Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/economics*,Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/epidemiology,Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/therapy,Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/virology,Computer Simulation*,Cost-Benefit Analysis,DNA, Viral/analysis*,Developing Countries/economics,Early Detection of Cancer/economics*,Early Detection of Cancer/methods,Female,Health Policy*,Healthcare Disparities,Humans,Life Expectancy,Mass Screening/economics*,Mass Screening/methods,Models, Economic*,Monte Carlo Method,Papillomaviridae/isolation & purification*,Papillomavirus Infections/diagnosis,Papillomavirus Infections/economics*,Papillomavirus Infections/epidemiology,Risk Reduction Behavior,Uganda/epidemiology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/economics*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/therapy,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/virology,DNA, Viral;27925175;

Toward optimal screening strategies for older women. Costs, benefits, and harms of breast cancer screening by age, biology, and health status.;;J Gen Intern Med. 2005 Jun.20(6):487-96.;Abstract CONTEXT: Optimal ages of breast cancer screening cessation remain uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate screening policies based on age and quartiles of life expectancy (LE). DESIGN AND POPULATION: We used a stochastic model with proxies of age-dependent biology to evaluate the incremental U.S. societal costs and benefits of biennial screening from age 50 until age 70, 79, or lifetime. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Discounted incremental costs per life years saved (LYS). RESULTS: Lifetime screening is expensive (151,434 dollars per LYS) if women have treatment and survival comparable to clinical trials (idealized). stopping at age 79 costs 82,063 dollars per LYS. This latter result corresponds to costs associated with an LE of 9.5 years at age 79, a value expected for 75% of 79-year-olds, about 50% of 80-year-olds, and 25% of 85-year-olds. Using actual treatment and survival patterns, screening benefits are greater, and lifetime screening of all women might be considered (114,905 dollars per LYS), especially for women in the top 25% of LE for their age (50,643 dollars per LYS, life expectancy of approximately 7 years at age 90). CONCLUSIONS: If all women receive idealized treatment, the benefits of mammography beyond age 79 are too low relative to their costs to justify continued screening. However, if treatment is not ideal, extending screening beyond age 79 could be considered, especially for women in the top 25% of life expectancy for their age.;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.,Age Factors,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Biomarkers, Tumor,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology,Breast Neoplasms/prevention & control,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Disease Progression,Female,Humans,Life Expectancy*,Mammography/economics*,Mass Screening/economics,Mass Screening/standards*,Mass Screening/utilization,Middle Aged,Models, Econometric,Monte Carlo Method,Neoplasm Staging,Sensitivity and Specificity,Stochastic Processes,Survival Analysis,Value of Life,Biomarkers, Tumor,R01 CA72908/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,UO1-CA88293A/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,K05 CA96940/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,K05 CA096940/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,R21 CA088293/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;15987322;
Trends in cancer of the cervix uteri in Sweden following cytological screening;Bergstrom R., Sparen P., Adami H.-O.;1999,British Journal of Cancer;Trends in cervical cancer incidence following the introduction of screening have mostly been studied using cross-sectional data and not analysed separately for squamous cell cancer and adenocarcinomas. Using Swedish nationwide data on incidence and mortality, we analysed trends during more than 3 decades and fitted Poisson-based age-period-cohort models, and also investigated whether screening has reduced the incidence of adenocarcinomas of the cervix. The incidence of reported cancer in situ increased rapidly during 1958-1967. Incidence rates of squamous cell cancer, fairly stable before 1968, decreased thereafter by 4-6% yearly in women aged 40-64, with a much smaller magnitude in younger and older women. An age-cohort model indicated a stable 70-75% reduction in incidence for women born 1940 and later compared with those born around 1923. The incidence of adenocarcinomas doubled during the 35-year study period. The mortality rate increased by 3.6% before 1968 and decreased by 4.0% yearly thereafter. Although a combination of organized and opportunistic screening can reduce the incidence of squamous cell cancer substantially, the incidence of adenocarcinomas appears uninfluenced by screening.;Adenocarcinoma, Age-period-cohort models, Cervical cancer, Cytological screening, Squamous cell cancer;;

Use of a mathematical model to evaluate breast cancer screening policy.;Baker RD1.;Health Care Manag Sci. 1998 Oct.1(2):103-13.;"Abstract A model of breast cancer screening was developed, in which the processes of tumour origination and growth, detection of tumours at screening, presentation of women with cancers to their GP, and of survival after diagnosis were modelled parametrically. The model was fitted to data from the North-West of the UK, for 413 women who screened positive, and for 761 women who developed interval cancers. Model validation comprised verification that the final model fitted the data adequately, together with the comparison of model predictions with findings by other workers. The mathematical model was used to assess different screening policies, and to ask ""what if"" questions. Taking the cost of breast cancer to be the sum of the cost of screening and the cost of PYLL (person years of life lost due to cancer), the optimal screening policy was calculated. The costs of the current policy and of other possible screening policies were found, together with their effects on life lost and on mortality. The tentative conclusion was that if monies can be found to extend the screening programme, for example to carry out one more screen per woman, most benefit would be obtained by reducing the start age of screening by 3 years.";Aged,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Evaluation Studies as Topic,Female,Health Policy*,Humans,Mass Screening/standards*,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical,Program Evaluation,United Kingdom;10916589;

Use of risk projection models to estimate mortality and incidence from radiation-induced breast cancer in screening programs.;Ramos M1, Ferrer S, Villaescusa JI, Verdƒó G, Salas MD, Cuevas MD.;Phys Med Biol. 2005 Feb 7.50(3):505-20.;Abstract The authors report on a method to calculate radiological risks, applicable to breast screening programs and other controlled medical exposures to ionizing radiation. In particular, it has been applied to make a risk assessment in the Valencian Breast Cancer Early Detection Program (VBCEDP) in Spain. This method is based on a parametric approach, through Markov processes, of hazard functions for radio-induced breast cancer incidence and mortality, with mean glandular breast dose, attained age and age-at-exposure as covariates. Excess relative risk functions of breast cancer mortality have been obtained from two different case-control studies exposed to ionizing radiation, with different follow-up time: the Canadian Fluoroscopy Cohort Study (1950--1987) and the Life Span Study (1950--1985 and 1950--1990), whereas relative risk functions for incidence have been obtained from the Life Span Study (1958--1993), the Massachusetts tuberculosis cohorts (1926--1985 and 1970--1985), the New York post-partum mastitis patients (1930--1981) and the Swedish benign breast disease cohort (1958--1987). Relative risks from these cohorts have been transported to the target population undergoing screening in the Valencian Community, a region in Spain with about four and a half million inhabitants. The SCREENRISK software has been developed to estimate radiological detriments in breast screening. Some hypotheses corresponding to different screening conditions have been considered in order to estimate the total risk associated with a woman who takes part in all screening rounds. In the case of the VBCEDP, the total radio-induced risk probability for fatal breast cancer is in a range between [5 x 10(-6), 6 x 10(-4)] versus the natural rate of dying from breast cancer in the Valencian Community which is 9.2 x 10(-3). The results show that these indicators could be included in quality control tests and could be adequate for making comparisons between several screening programs.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Age Factors,Age of Onset,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/etiology,Breast Neoplasms/mortality*,Case-Control Studies,Cohort Studies,Female,Humans,Incidence,Mammography,Markov Chains,Mass Screening,Models, Statistical,Models, Theoretical,Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/diagnosis*,Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/mortality*,Proportional Hazards Models,Risk,Spain;15773726;

Epub 2016 Jul 28.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Modeling breast cancer progression and the effect of various risk is helpful in deciding when a woman should start and end screening, and how often the screening should be undertaken. METHODS: We modeled the natural progression of breast cancer using a hidden Markov process, and incorporated the effects of covariates. Patients are women aged 50-59 (older) and 40-49 (younger) years from the Canadian National Breast Screening Studies. We included prevalent cancers, estimated the screening sensitivities and rates of over-diagnosis, and validated the models using simulation. RESULTS: We found that older women have a higher rate of transition from a healthy to preclinical state and other causes of death but a lower rate of transition from preclinical to clinical state. Reciprocally, younger women have a lower rate of transition from a healthy to preclinical state and other causes of death but a higher rate of transition from a preclinical to clinical state. Different risk factors were significant for the age groups. The mean sojourn times for older and younger women were 2.53 and 2.96 years, respectively. In the study group, the sensitivities of the initial physical examination and mammography for older and younger women were 0.87 and 0.81, respectively, and the sensitivity of the subsequent screens were 0.78 and 0.53, respectively. In the control groups, the sensitivities of the initial physical examination for older and younger women were 0.769 and 0.671, respectively, and the sensitivity of the subsequent physical examinations for the control group aged 50-59 years was 0.37. The upper-bounds for over-diagnosis in older and younger women were 25% and 27%, respectively.

Using simulation-optimization to construct screening strategies for cervical cancer.;;Health Care Manag Sci. 2010 Dec.13(4):294-318. doi: 10.1007/s10729-010-9131-x. Epub 2010 Jun 5.;Abstract Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in women worldwide. Cervical screening is critical for preventing this type of cancer. Traditionally, screening strategies are evaluated from an economic point of view through cost-effectiveness analysis. However, cost-effectiveness analysis is typically performed on a limited number of de facto or predetermined screening policies. We develop a simulation-optimization model to determine the ages at which screening should be performed, resulting in dynamic, age-based screening policies. We consider three performance measures: cervical cancer incidence, the number of cervical cancer deaths, and the number of life years lost due to cervical cancer death. Using each performance measure, we compare our optimal, dynamic screening strategies to standard policies considered in the health screening literature that are static and predetermined. We also evaluate the anticipated impact of vaccinations for preventing cervical cancer. The strategies that are developed are compared to those used in practice or considered in the literature. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends one screening every 3 years, resulting in 14 scheduled lifetime screenings. Our dynamic screening strategies provide approximately the same health benefits as this but with four to six fewer scheduled screenings, depending on the performance measure considered. Our dynamic strategies also provide approximately the same health benefits as screening every 2 years, but with six to nine fewer scheduled screenings. The results suggest that dynamic, age-based cervical cancer screening policies offer substantial economic savings in order to offer the same health benefits as equally spaced screening strategies.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adolescent,Adult,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Algorithms,Female,Humans,Mass Screening/organization & administration*,Middle Aged,Models, Theoretical,Preventive Medicine,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control*,Women's Health,Young Adult;20963551;

Value Of Waiving Coinsurance For Colorectal Cancer Screening In Medicare Beneficiaries.;Peterse EFP1, Meester RGS2, Gini A3, Doubeni CA4, Anderson DS5, Berger FG6, Zauber AG7, Lansdorp-Vogelaar I8.;Health Aff (Millwood). 2017 Dec.36(12):2151-2159. doi: 10.1377/hlthaff.2017.0228.;Abstract Financial barriers to colorectal cancer screening persist despite the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Medicare beneficiaries may face 20 percent coinsurance for a screening colonoscopy when the procedure includes the removal of polyps or follows a positive fecal screening test. Using an established microsimulation model, we estimated that waiving this coinsurance would result in 1.7 fewer colorectal cancer deaths (a decrease of 13 percent) and $17,000 higher colorectal cancer-related costs (an increase of 0.6 percent) for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services per 1,000 sixty-five-year-olds, assuming a 10-percentage-point increase in the rates of first colonoscopy screening, follow-up, and surveillance. If the rates did not change, waiving coinsurance would increase total costs by $51,000 (1.9 percent) per 1,000 sixty-five-year-olds. Estimated screening benefits were comparable when fecal testing was assumed to be the primary screening method. Moreover, waiving coinsurance would be cost-effective if the screening rate increased by 0.6 percentage points, assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Thus, the waiver is likely to have a favorable balance of health and cost impact.;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Aged,Colonoscopy/economics,Colonoscopy/statistics & numerical data,Colorectal Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Cost-Benefit Analysis/economics,Cost-Benefit Analysis/methods,Deductibles and Coinsurance/economics,Deductibles and Coinsurance/statistics & numerical data*,Early Detection of Cancer/economics*,Female,Humans,Male,Mass Screening/economics*,Medicare/economics*,Medicare/statistics & numerical data,Medicare/trends,Occult Blood,United States,P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,U01 CA199335/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;29200350;

What happens when organization of cervical cancer screening is delayed or stopped?;Lynge E1, Clausen LB, Guignard R, Poll P.;J Med Screen. 2006.13(1):41-6.;Abstract OBJECTIVES: Many countries rely on opportunistic screening, and data on its effectiveness are asked for. We assessed the impact on cervical cancer incidence and mortality of opportunistic screening compared with organized screening. SETTING: Women aged 30-64 in Denmark, 1973-2002. 16 counties with different screening strategies. METHODS: Cumulative incidence and mortality rates for women aged 30-64 by county. Poisson regression of incidence and mortality rates by age, calendar period and county. Interaction between type of county and calendar period measured the difference between counties with screening organized early versus late in time. RESULTS: A statistically significant interaction was found between type of county and calendar period (P=0.0151) for cervical cancer incidence, but not for cervical cancer mortality (P=0.9593). The interaction terms were not statistically significant when a comparison was made between a single county in which an organized programme was interrupted for an 11-year period and other counties. There was, however, a statistically significant increased incidence and mortality rates at the restart of the organized programme. CONCLUSION: Organization of cervical cancer screening accelerated the decline in cervical cancer incidence, compared with the trend in areas relying on opportunistic screening. No impact could be measured of the screening organization on cervical cancer mortality. A decade long stop of an organized screening programme was associated with a temporary increase in cervical cancer incidence and mortality. Coverage remains a key quality indicator in the ongoing modernization of screening technology.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Age Factors,Female,Humans,Incidence,Mass Screening/methods,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical,Precancerous Conditions,Risk Factors,Risk Management,Time Factors,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/pathology*;16569305;
What is the best screening strategy to detect advanced colorectal adenomas? Simulation from ongoing Italian screening experiences.;;Tumori. 2011 Sep-Oct.97(5):547-50. doi: 10.1700/989.10709.;Abstract AIMS AND BACKGROUND: The best screening strategy for colorectal cancer is still debated. We simulated two screening strategies, namely flexible sigmoidoscopy (single episode) and immunological fecal occult blood test (FOBT) (five biennial rounds) and comparing their results as regards advanced adenomas and colorectal cancer detection. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to estimate the number of advanced adenomas and colorectal cancer detected with the two compared screening strategies. Two different scenarios, namely a) where the same compliance (50%) at both flexible sigmoidoscopy and immunological FOBT invitation is applied, and b) where the actual compliance observed at a national level (immunological FOBT, 45%. flexible sigmoidoscopy, 30%) is applied. RESULTS: In scenario a), immunological FOBT would detect a total of 20,573 adenomas and 3,952 colorectal cancers, performing 74,507 total colonoscopies compared to 20,939 and 2,511, respectively, detected by flexible sigmoidoscopy, with 17,985 total colonoscopies. In scenario b), immunological FOBT would detect 17,845 advanced adenomas with 65,215 colonoscopies performed compared to 12,672 detected by flexible sigmoidoscopy with 10,796 colonoscopies. The probability of having a colonoscopy for a subject attending all the five immunological FOBT rounds was 15.9%. CONCLUSIONS: The simulation suggests that also immunological FOBT screening may achieve a substantial detection of advanced adenomas and therefore may have an impact on colorectal cancer incidence.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adenoma/diagnosis,Adenoma/epidemiology,Carcinoma/diagnosis,Carcinoma/epidemiology,Colonoscopy,Colorectal Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Colorectal Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Colorectal Neoplasms/pathology,Early Detection of Cancer/methods*,Female,Humans,Italy/epidemiology,Male,Mass Screening/methods*,Occult Blood*,Patient Compliance/statistics & numerical data,Sigmoidoscopy*/statistics & numerical data;22158481;

When budgets are tight, there are better options than colonoscopies for colorectal cancer screening.;;Health Aff (Millwood). 2010 Sep.29(9):1734-40. doi: 10.1377/hlthaff.2008.0898. Epub 2010 Jul 29.;Abstract A critical challenge facing cancer screening programs, particularly those aimed at uninsured people with low incomes, is choosing the screening test that makes the most efficient use of limited budgets. For colorectal cancer screening, there is growing momentum to use colonoscopy, which is an expensive test. In this study, we modeled scenarios to assess whether the use of fecal occult blood tests or colonoscopy provides the most benefit under conditions of budget constraints. We found that although colonoscopy is more accurate, under most scenarios, fecal occult blood tests would result in more individuals' getting screened, with more life-years gained.;Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.,Budgets*,Colonoscopy/economics*,Colonoscopy/utilization,Colorectal Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Colorectal Neoplasms/prevention & control,Computer Simulation,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Guidelines as Topic,Humans,Occult Blood*,Quality of Life,1 P30 CD000138-01/CD/ODCDC CDC HHS/United States;20671020;
Why worry about awareness in choice problems? Econometric analysis of screening for cervical cancer.;Belkar R1, Fiebig DG, Haas M, Viney R.;Health Econ. 2006 Jan.15(1):33-47.;Abstract The decision to undertake a screening test is conditional upon awareness of screening. From an econometric perspective there is a potential selection problem, if no distinction is made between aware and unaware non-screeners. This paper explores this problem through analysis of the determinants of cervical screening in Australia. Cervical cancer is one of the most preventable and curable forms of cancer. Since 1991 there has been a concerted effort in Australia to recommend and encourage women to have Pap smears every two years. The success of this program can be partly gauged by exploring the determinants of screening for cervical cancer. Using unit record data from the 1995 National Health Survey, an econometric model is developed for whether women have ever screened or not. A proportion of women in the sample contend that they have never heard of a Pap test. The analysis characterizes this group of women and accounts for their presence in the modelling. The paper demonstrates failing to model awareness can result in inconsistent parameter estimates even when the degree of censoring in the sample is relatively small.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adolescent,Adult,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Australia,Choice Behavior,Female,Health Care Surveys,Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice*,Humans,Mass Screening/economics,Mass Screening/methods,Mass Screening/utilization*,Middle Aged,Models, Econometric*,National Health Programs,Papanicolaou Test*,Patient Acceptance of Health Care*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/economics,Vaginal Smears/economics,Vaginal Smears/utilization*;16145719;
